1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,807
In early 1972, a probe known as Pioneer 10 was launched into space

2
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:21,786
on a mission to the largest planet in the Solar System.

3
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,396
After millennia of speculation and wonder,

4
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:28,596
humanity got its first close-up view of Jupiter.

5
00:00:30,122 --> 00:00:33,088
Accelerated by the immense gravity of the planet,

6
00:00:33,113 --> 00:00:36,216
Pioneer 10 was then catapulted into deep space,

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,984
destined to leave the Solar System and roam the galaxy for billions of years.

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,495
On the off-chance that this vestige of humanity

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,256
should one day be intercepted by an alien intelligence,

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,503
it was affixed with a message.

11
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:55,280
A message designed to answer three central questions.

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,878
[Carl Sagan] Where we are, when we are, and who we are.

13
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:06,478
More than half a century has now passed

14
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:08,838
since the launch of our first galactic emissary,

15
00:01:08,863 --> 00:01:13,206
and in that time, we've made numerous attempts to communicate with life beyond.

16
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:17,729
Either by attaching greeting cards to probes headed for interstellar space

17
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:22,375
or by targeting our cosmic neighbors with high-powered beams of light.

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,302
So far, humanity's been left on read, but that could change at any moment.

19
00:01:27,327 --> 00:01:31,074
As long as we keep making noise, there's always a chance we'll be heard.

20
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:36,160
An exceedingly slim chance, as we'll see, but a non-zero chance nonetheless.

21
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:40,536
Given the paradigm-shifting potential of contacting beings from another world,

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,542
it sure would be nice to know what exactly we've been telling them all these years.

23
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:45,928
I mean, don't get me wrong,

24
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:48,167
"Where we are, when we are, and who we are",

25
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:52,060
sounds really neat and all, but it's not exactly rich in detail.

26
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:54,974
So let's start with that plaque on Pioneer 10.

27
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:57,488
What does it say, and more importantly,

28
00:01:57,513 --> 00:02:02,289
to whom should I direct my anger when the aliens arrive to harvest my bones?

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,268
The idea to attach a nmessage to Pioneer 10

30
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:20,808
was the brainchild of journalist and author Eric Burgess.

31
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,684
Less than four months before the probe was scheduled to launch,

32
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,725
Burgess approached famed astronomer and science communicator Carl Sagan,

33
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,256
who, in turn, relayed the proposal to NASA.

34
00:02:30,268 --> 00:02:32,739
Sagan was given three weeks to devise the message,

35
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:34,981
and with the help of his wife and artist Linda

36
00:02:34,993 --> 00:02:37,096
as well as fellow astronomer Frank Drake,

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,715
they scrambled together a series of pictograms

38
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,296
etched into a gold-laden plate of aluminum.

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,747
In the words of Sagan...

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,720
Near the upper-left corner, we find a diagram of hydrogen,

41
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:56,066
the simplest and most abundant element in the universe.

42
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:59,079
One electron bound to a proton.

43
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:03,010
More specifically, the diagram depicts a single atom of hydrogen

44
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:05,896
transitioning from one energy state to another,

45
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,731
which is meant to be conveyed by this horizontal line here in the middle.

46
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,232
This shift in energy is known as a hyperfine transition,

47
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:16,138
and it's accompanied by the emission of a radio wave.

48
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,948
That radio wave has a very specific frequency

49
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:22,552
that's so prominent across the universe that we've given it a name,

50
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,276
the hydrogen line.

51
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:26,494
Something that beings of sufficient intelligence

52
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,400
to capture a drifting spacecraft

53
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:30,696
would no doubt be aware of as well.

54
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,812
In human terms, it has a frequency of about 1420 megahertz

55
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:41,116
which means that each cycle of the wave has a period of about 0.7 nanoseconds

56
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:44,847
and a corresponding length of roughly 21 centimeters.

57
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:47,336
The recipients would obviously express their measurements

58
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,624
using something other than nanoseconds and centimeters,

59
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:53,388
but what's important here is that they're measuring the same thing

60
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:55,716
and that that thing never changes.

61
00:03:55,741 --> 00:04:00,000
The duration of one wavecycle and the distance covered during that cycle

62
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:02,776
remains the same across the universe.

63
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,853
This allows us to establish a shared unit of both time and length.

64
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:09,573
We're basically telling the aliens to treat their measurement

65
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,460
of the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen

66
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,892
as one unit of time and one unit of length.

67
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:18,196
That's why there's a vertical line here in the middle,

68
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:21,921
which is meant to convey the concept of one in binary.

69
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:24,454
But, of course, hydrogen is merely one of many

70
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,919
possible interpretations of this diagram.

71
00:04:26,944 --> 00:04:30,012
The aliens could just as easily think it's some sort of language,

72
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:33,707
technology, star system, or literally anything else.

73
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:37,439
To help them narrow down the list, the plaque includes three outlined silhouettes

74
00:04:37,464 --> 00:04:40,328
of a man, a woman, and Pioneer 10.

75
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:42,067
These illustrations were drawn to scale,

76
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:44,769
so the aliens can use the spacecraft's diameter

77
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:48,548
as a basis for deriving the height of the two figures in the foreground.

78
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:52,918
In human terms, that would make the man approximately 182 centimeters

79
00:04:52,943 --> 00:04:55,656
and the woman about 169.

80
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,634
The woman's height has been further emphasized

81
00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:00,616
by two demarcation marks along the right edge here.

82
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,416
Between them is a sequence of four lines representing the number eight in binary.

83
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,146
The purpose of this number is to communicate to the aliens

84
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:12,579
that the woman is eight times as tall as the wavelength of the hydrogen line.

85
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,902
In human terms, that's about 169,

86
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:19,769
just like the woman's height relative to the probe's diameter.

87
00:05:19,794 --> 00:05:24,054
In other words, the interpretation of this as a schematic of hydrogen

88
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,785
and the interpretation of this as an outline of the spacecraft

89
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:29,816
are mutually corroborative.

90
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,357
They provide the aliens with a means of deriving the height of this figure

91
00:05:33,382 --> 00:05:35,630
on the basis of two distinct measurements,

92
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:39,718
which should help them narrow down the list of possible interpretations.

93
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:43,572
At least, that was the idea.

94
00:05:43,596 --> 00:05:46,056
But when you actually measure the height of the couple

95
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,018
relative to this sketch of the probe,

96
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:51,736
you quickly realize they're about 10 centimeters too tall.

97
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,937
While I have no way of confirming this, I suspect the source of this discrepancy

98
00:05:55,962 --> 00:05:59,973
is that the reflector dish on Pioneer 10 is not a perfect circle.

99
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:03,131
It's slightly wider in this dimension than in this one,

100
00:06:03,157 --> 00:06:05,485
known as a major and minor axis.

101
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,434
If we assume that this outline of the probe

102
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:10,136
is oriented with the minor axis along the vertical,

103
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,896
the relative height of the couple is indeed what you'd expect.

104
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,439
But if that is what the Sagans and Drake intended,

105
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:20,246
only two of the three antenna struts should be visible here in the front.

106
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:22,856
The fact that all three have been drawn on the plaque,

107
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,616
implies the probe is oriented with the major axis along the vertical,

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,774
thereby increasing the couples' height by roughly 10 centimeters.

109
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,817
Nevertheless, it's hardly surprising for an oversight like this to go unnoticed

110
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:38,296
given they only had three weeks to assemble everything,

111
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,719
and Sagan acknowledged they could have done a better job

112
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:42,886
had they not been so pressed for time.

113
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,632
Moving on to the left side of the plaque,

114
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:50,644
we find a starburst pattern of 15 straight lines emanating from a central point.

115
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:52,883
This is a galactic map of pulsars

116
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:56,216
that's meant to help the aliens pinpoint the Solar System.

117
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,909
Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that can easily be spotted

118
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:03,205
from thousands or even millions of lightyears away.

119
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,784
They're often described as cosmic clocks or

120
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:08,923
lighthouses because they're not only extremely bright

121
00:07:08,948 --> 00:07:11,926
but pulsate at very consistent rates.

122
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:14,122
This red line shooting off to the right

123
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:17,968
represents the distance between the Sun and the center of the galaxy,

124
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:20,572
while the green lines represent the relative distance

125
00:07:20,597 --> 00:07:23,407
between the Sun and 14 pulsars.

126
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:25,676
To make it easier to identify the pulsars,

127
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:29,437
each line is accompanied by the star's rotation period expressed in binary,

128
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:31,256
marked here in blue.

129
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,554
Take this one, for instance.

130
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:37,311
This star is known as the Vela Pulsar, and it's about 1 000 lightyears from Earth.

131
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:41,974
Its rotation period has been expressed in waveperiods of the hydrogen line

132
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:50,295
and reads 126 726 823 when translated from binary to decimal.

133
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,672
What that means is that it takes the Vela Pulsar

134
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:57,377
almost 127 million times longer to complete one rotation

135
00:07:57,402 --> 00:08:01,697
than the waveperiod of a hydrogen atom undergoing hyperfine transition.

136
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:05,901
In human terms, that's about 89 million nanoseconds or

137
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:09,958
eleven rotations every second, which is about this fast.

138
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,222
By scouring the galaxy for pulsars

139
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:24,751
that match the information embedded within this map,

140
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:28,617
the aliens could theoretically triangulate the Solar System.

141
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:33,725
In fact, the chart not only discloses our location in space but also in time.

142
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,234
As Sagan put it...

143
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:39,039
[Carl Sagan] Where we are, when we are, and who we are.

144
00:08:39,064 --> 00:08:41,581
This goes back to the cosmic clock analogy

145
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:44,870
because pulsars gradually wind down at highly predictable rates.

146
00:08:44,895 --> 00:08:48,297
So even though the Vela Pulsar will have a much slower rate of spin

147
00:08:48,322 --> 00:08:50,806
by the time it's observed by our hypothetical aliens,

148
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:54,260
they could simply wind back the clock until its rotation period

149
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:56,520
matched the one etched into the plaque.

150
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:59,482
Repeating that process for at least some of the other pulsars

151
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:01,980
would enable them to figure out not just from where,

152
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:04,633
but also when Pioneer 10 was launched.

153
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:08,264
At least, that was the idea.

154
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:09,725
But when the plaque was created,

155
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,103
the existence of pulsars had only been known for about four years.

156
00:09:13,128 --> 00:09:15,297
Astronomers have since learned a lot more about them,

157
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:19,825
and they're not nearly as rare, stable, and long-lived as once believed.

158
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,134
They can only be observed from very specific vantage points, and

159
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:26,401
unpredictable speedups, slowdowns, and glitches

160
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:28,860
challenge the cosmic clock analogy.

161
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:31,194
Sagan and Drake were aware of at least

162
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:34,125
some of these issues, but there was only so much they could've foreseen

163
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,967
with the limited data available at the time.

164
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:38,941
In fact, there was such great uncertainty

165
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:41,626
regarding the distance of some of the featured pulsars

166
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:43,925
that they added these breaks in the lines,

167
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,191
indicating they're based on rough estimates rather than exact figures.

168
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,341
Finally, on the bottom of the plaque,

169
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:54,394
we find a plain schematic of the Solar System.

170
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:58,039
These binary numbers represent the orbital distance of each planet

171
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:04,102
expressed as multiples of one tenth of the mean distance between the Sun and Mercury.

172
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:07,788
For instance, the number above Earth reads 26 in decimal,

173
00:10:07,813 --> 00:10:10,298
which means it is 26 times further away

174
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:14,456
than 10% of the distance between the Sun and Mercury.

175
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,336
The obvious problem with this approach

176
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:20,597
is that it requires the recipients to already be familiar with the Solar System.

177
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:24,327
Otherwise, one tenth of the distance between the Sun and Mercury

178
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:25,769
is completely meaningless.

179
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:29,975
We might as well have expected them to be familiar with kilometers or miles.

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,069
To quote the creators of the plaque...

181
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:38,813
It's unclear why the Sagans and Drake

182
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,747
knowingly used an indecipherable unit of length

183
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:45,332
when they had already gone through the trouble of creating a universal yardstick

184
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:47,732
with this schematic of hydrogen.

185
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:51,718
My best guess is that the wavelength of a state-shifting hydrogen atom

186
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:56,076
was simply too small a unit to represent interplanetary distances,

187
00:10:56,101 --> 00:11:00,814
and the resulting binary strings became too long to neatly fit on the plaque.

188
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,587
Again, they only had three weeks to do all of this.

189
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:08,936
Last but not least, the trajectory of the spacecraft has been traced with an arrow,

190
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,406
and the probe's main antenna is pointing at home.

191
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,997
Over half a century later,

192
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:25,576
Pioneer 10 is now more than 20 billion kilometers from the Sun.

193
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,202
That might sound like a lot, especially given how I just emphasized that number,

194
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:32,207
but it's only about three times further away than Pluto,

195
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:36,566
and it takes less than a day for a light beam to cover the same distance.

196
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:40,387
Even though it's darting through space at several kilometers per second,

197
00:11:40,412 --> 00:11:43,560
the probe won't surpass even the nearest star to the Sun

198
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:46,312
for many tens of thousands of years.

199
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:50,900
But it gets worse because Pioneer 10 is not headed for any particular star.

200
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:55,627
It's expected to pass within a few trillion kilometers of a relatively nearby system

201
00:11:55,652 --> 00:12:00,000
in about 90 000 years or so when this star, all the way out here,

202
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:04,136
will come closer to the Sun than Proxima Centauri is today.

203
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,241
While an exoplanet has yet to be detected around this star,

204
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:10,883
if one does exist, and that planet just so happens to be inhabited

205
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:15,051
by intelligent beings in possession of technology that allows them to detect a

206
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:19,676
perfectly silent and practically invisible speck gently gliding by their system

207
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:23,506
at a distance greater than a thousand times the orbit of Pluto,

208
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:24,789
then, yeah...

209
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,103
...maybe they'll see it.

210
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:36,102
A nearly identical probe was launched in 1973 known as Pioneer 11,

211
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:39,296
and it was outfitted with the exact same plaque as Pioneer 10.

212
00:12:39,321 --> 00:12:43,862
Much like its predecessor, Pioneer 11 was just kind of hurtled into deep space

213
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:46,367
with no particular target in mind.

214
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:50,936
While a chance encounter with another planetary system is not impossible,

215
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,816
even across timescales of many billions of years,

216
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,884
Sagan and Drake believed it was more likely

217
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,451
for the probes to be scooped up by an alien spaceship

218
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:00,369
traveling between the stars.

219
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:03,364
Some studies have shown that space is, in fact,

220
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:04,609
a tiny bit big.

221
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,178
It's very easy to criticize the Pioneer Plaques.

222
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:14,597
Any message designed to be understood by beings of which we know nothing about will

223
00:13:14,622 --> 00:13:18,136
unavoidably rely upon assumptions that could easily be false.

224
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,538
Will the aliens understand the meaning of an arrow?

225
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:23,104
Will they comprehend binary notation?

226
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:26,648
Will they even grasp the concept of conveying information

227
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,985
using two-dimensional pictograms?

228
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,119
While questions like these are perfectly valid,

229
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:36,408
they're ultimately quite pointless because the answer is always the same.

230
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:37,754
We don't know.

231
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:42,569
We don't know what the aliens look like, how they think, or even if they exist.

232
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:46,447
The plaque could be so at odds with how they perceive and navigate the universe

233
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:49,255
they fail to even recognize it as a message

234
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,341
or we might be foolish for thinking a civilization so technologically advanced

235
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:58,131
they're able to locate and retrieve a derelict spacecraft from the dead of space

236
00:13:58,156 --> 00:14:00,873
will be stumped by an interstellar cave painting.

237
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:07,287
While many believe the recipients will be nothing like us,

238
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:09,609
we could just as easily have a lot in common.

239
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:11,693
After all, we share the same universe

240
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:15,713
and are therefore shaped and bound by the same physical laws of nature.

241
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:18,215
In fact, that's what some people fear the most.

242
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,018
That the aliens could be just like us.

243
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:26,003
That they could inflict upon us what we inflict upon members of our own species.

244
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:28,403
The Sagans and Drake tried to get ahead of these concerns

245
00:14:28,428 --> 00:14:31,690
by emphasizing the improbability of interception.

246
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:34,886
They stressed that, even if the probes were to fall into the tentacles

247
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:37,920
of a hostile intelligence in some distant future,

248
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,592
they'd be too far away to pose a threat.

249
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:44,567
But statistics and probability only get you so far

250
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,980
because fear is a powerful emotion.

251
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:52,037
[George Wald] And may I say so that we can have a

252
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:57,777
somewhat warmer and livelier conversation as this meeting goes on.

253
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:08,853
I can conceive of no nightmare as terrifying as establishing such communication

254
00:15:08,878 --> 00:15:16,438
with a so-called superior or, if you wish, advanced technology in outer space.

255
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,214
A year after the launch of Pioneer 11, the Arecibo Radio Observatory,

256
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:47,427
located deep within the jungles of Puerto Rico, received a major facelift.

257
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:51,576
The telescope was not only resurfaced to greatly increase its sensitivity,

258
00:15:51,588 --> 00:15:54,376
but also outfitted with a powerful transmitter.

259
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,732
As it happens, the man in charge of the research center overseeing the facility

260
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,998
was none other than Frank Drake.

261
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:04,146
To celebrate the telescope's upgraded capabilities,

262
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,136
Drake's assistant, Jane Allen,

263
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,443
suggested they transmit an interstellar message

264
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,776
during the upcoming rededication ceremony.

265
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,884
Unlike the tangible Pioneer Plaques,

266
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:17,411
the Arecibo Message had to be communicated using invisible radio waves.

267
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,726
Drake had previously experimented with the idea

268
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:22,268
of transmitting an image coded in binary,

269
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:26,610
and with the help of some colleagues and graduate students, he came up with this.

270
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:28,296
Now, this may not look like much,

271
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,725
but if we fill in all the zeros with black squares

272
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,776
and all the ones with white squares,

273
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,557
a highly pixelated image will emerge.

274
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:37,421
I'll explain the different parts in just a moment,

275
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:40,522
but first, it's important to understand how an image like this

276
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:42,616
is converted into radio waves.

277
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,207
It starts with a grid that, in this case, is 23 columns wide and 73 rows tall

278
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:52,382
for a total of 1 679 cells.

279
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:55,321
We then fill in the cells needed to create the image.

280
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:58,795
Because the image is composed of only two shades, black and white,

281
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,536
that means it's binary,

282
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,234
and each cell can also be described as a binary digit, or bit for short.

283
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:10,056
By convention, binary code is expressed using zeros and ones,

284
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,456
but it works just as well with two different shapes, two different colors,

285
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,832
two different rocks, or literally any combination of two contrasting values.

286
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:22,666
In fact, that's why binary code is so frequently used

287
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,492
to write interstellar messages.

288
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:27,689
It's not because aliens are guaranteed to understand it.

289
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,407
No, it's simply one of the least complicated methods

290
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:32,847
of conveying information that we can imagine.

291
00:17:32,872 --> 00:17:35,393
Chinese is composed of thousands of characters,

292
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:37,172
English has 26 letters,

293
00:17:37,197 --> 00:17:39,997
while decimal demands 10 unique numerals.

294
00:17:40,022 --> 00:17:42,351
Binary only requires two.

295
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:49,255
Not two letters, not two symbols, literally just two of something, which we call bits.

296
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,606
For instance, instead of black and white squares,

297
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:56,012
we could just as easily express this bitmap using two different frequencies.

298
00:17:56,037 --> 00:17:58,422
If a cell is black, that's one frequency.

299
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,809
If it's white, that's another.

300
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,089
There you go. That's all there's to it.

301
00:18:17,368 --> 00:18:20,456
This long sequence of two flip-flopping frequencies

302
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,478
can now be transmitted using a radio telescope.

303
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:26,656
When that signal is picked up by an alien astronomer,

304
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:31,677
they may find it difficult to ascribe such an unnatural pattern to a natural source.

305
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:35,738
This will hopefully draw attention to the number of frequency fluctuations because

306
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:39,918
1 679 is what's known as a semiprime.

307
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:43,540
It's disappointingly not the half-brother of Optimus Prime,

308
00:18:43,565 --> 00:18:46,621
but rather the product of precisely two prime numbers.

309
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:50,274
In this case, those prime numbers are 23 and 73,

310
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:53,344
which happens to be the dimensions of the original grid.

311
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:57,012
If the aliens were to plot the frequencies onto a grid of that size

312
00:18:57,037 --> 00:19:00,137
and fill in all the cells occupied by one of the values,

313
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:01,823
they would uncover the image.

314
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,408
As for the contents of the message,

315
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:08,701
it starts off easy enough with the numbers 1 through 10 expressed in binary

316
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:10,722
and written from right-to-left.

317
00:19:10,747 --> 00:19:14,894
So 0-0-1, 0-1-0, 0-1-1, and so on.

318
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,656
Moving on to this large cluster of pixels,

319
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,481
we find a bunch of binary formulations for the building blocks of life as we know it.

320
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:25,476
It starts with the atomic numbers of five basic elements:

321
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,884
hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus.

322
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:33,496
These numbers are then used to describe essential components of DNA.

323
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,445
For instance, a carbon atom has six protons,

324
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,096
which means it has an atomic number of six.

325
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,564
0-1-1-0 is binary for decimal 6.

326
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:45,523
Because carbon is in the second column from the right,

327
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:48,705
it means the second column of these molecules underneath

328
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,339
indicates how many carbon atoms they contain.

329
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:55,256
So these four represent an organic compound known as deoxyribose,

330
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,376
which has five carbon atoms, and 1-0-1 is binary for decimal 5.

331
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,416
In the center of the image, we find a crude rendition of the DNA double helix

332
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:06,491
enclosing a large binary value

333
00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:10,856
denoting the number of nucleotide base pairs in the human genome.

334
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,314
In simpler terms, it's a way of expressing the complexity or

335
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,366
size of our genetic makeup.

336
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:20,642
However, more recent measurements have since reduced that number by over a billion,

337
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:23,404
so this figure is no longer accurate.

338
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:26,671
A bit further down, we find a simple sketch of a human,

339
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:29,538
alongside an expression of their height on the right

340
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:33,841
and the estimated global population in 1974 on the left.

341
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:39,816
Directly underneath the human is a schematic of the Solar System,

342
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,056
followed by an illustration of the Arecibo Telescope.

343
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,637
Now, you might be wondering,

344
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:49,096
"How the hell were the aliens supposed to understand any of that?"

345
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,473
The simple answer is, they weren't really.

346
00:20:51,497 --> 00:20:53,666
Unlike the Pioneer Plaques' commendable attempt

347
00:20:53,691 --> 00:20:57,393
to establish some sort of common ground using shared units of measurement

348
00:20:57,418 --> 00:20:59,835
and a galactic map of pulsars,

349
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:03,176
the Arecibo Message was much more of a publicity stunt.

350
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,080
For instance, the length of the message

351
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:08,369
was largely determined by the presumed attention span

352
00:21:08,394 --> 00:21:11,003
of those invited to the rededication ceremony.

353
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:13,464
The concern was that, if the message was too long,

354
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:16,456
attendees might be annoyed by the sound of the transmission,

355
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,113
which was planned to be broadcast over loudspeakers at the event.

356
00:21:20,138 --> 00:21:23,142
In the end, the message was constrained to about three minutes

357
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:25,727
to mitigate the risk of a dull afternoon.

358
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:30,991
Likewise, the selection of a target for the transmission was entirely dictated

359
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:34,320
by what happened to be visible in the sky during the ceremony.

360
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:38,435
Drake ultimately selected a bright cluster of stars known as Messier 13,

361
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,434
which is about 24 000 lightyears from Earth.

362
00:21:43,227 --> 00:21:48,032
While this meant the message would take 24 000 years to reach its destination,

363
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,458
the density of M13 also meant the signal could sweep over many

364
00:21:51,483 --> 00:21:53,604
thousands of stars upon arrival.

365
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:58,131
At the time, this was thought to maximize the odds of the transmission being received,

366
00:21:58,156 --> 00:22:00,164
and Carl Sagan even told a reporter

367
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:05,698
that he believed there was a 50% chance that M13 was home to an alien civilization.

368
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:09,080
But as it turns out, more stars

369
00:22:09,105 --> 00:22:12,828
does not necessarily mean more opportunities for life.

370
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:17,648
Not only are globular clusters like M13 typically starved of heavier elements

371
00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:20,036
essential for planetary formation,

372
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,915
but the proximity of the stars makes it challenging for any planets that do form

373
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,952
to maintain stable orbits.

374
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,609
Considering it took billions of years before humans evolved on Earth,

375
00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:33,082
a region as densely packed and chaotic as M13

376
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:37,526
is probably not the most conducive environment for life as we know it.

377
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:41,654
While there is some optimism that small planets like Earth

378
00:22:41,678 --> 00:22:43,976
could survive in very tight orbits,

379
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,901
out of six thousand exoplanets discovered to date,

380
00:22:46,926 --> 00:22:50,381
only two are located within a globuluster.

381
00:22:52,514 --> 00:22:55,699
Nevertheless, on November 16, 1974,

382
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:58,854
a small crowd of astronomers, dignitaries, and others

383
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:02,379
bopped along to a three-minute concert of two warbling tones

384
00:23:02,404 --> 00:23:07,381
as humanity's first interstellar radiotelegram was beamed into space.

385
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,782
A common misconception about the Arecibo Message

386
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:34,683
is that it will miss its target because the telescope was aimed at the position of M13

387
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:39,938
at the time of transmission, rather than where it will be in 24 000 years.

388
00:23:39,963 --> 00:23:43,597
In reality, when Drake crunched the numbers back in 1974,

389
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,949
he realized that the cluster was so enormous and slow-moving

390
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:50,462
that even if they aimed the telescope at its location at the time,

391
00:23:50,487 --> 00:23:54,921
the message would simply strike slightly off-center rather than a bullseye.

392
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:59,735
Presuming against all odds that M13 is home to an alien civilization

393
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,328
in possession of an extremely sensitive instrument that's not only designed

394
00:24:03,353 --> 00:24:06,594
to pick up radio waves at the exact same frequency and bandwidth

395
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:08,813
at which the Arecibo Message was transmitted,

396
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:12,649
but also pointed squarely at the Solar System at just the right time,

397
00:24:12,674 --> 00:24:15,192
Messierian astronomers will have a non-zero chance

398
00:24:15,217 --> 00:24:19,416
to detect a non-repeating burst of energy lasting for less than three minutes

399
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:21,883
some 24 000 years from now.

400
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:25,494
Even though they're unlikely to decode the message,

401
00:24:25,518 --> 00:24:28,447
they might still suspect it's an attempt at communication.

402
00:24:28,472 --> 00:24:30,763
It's a bit like, even if you don't speak Swedish...

403
00:24:30,788 --> 00:24:33,841
*SWEDISH NOISES*

404
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,343
If they suspect it's a transmission from another civilization,

405
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:42,536
the aliens may choose to respond.

406
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,937
Presuming there's no way to overcome the speed of light,

407
00:24:44,962 --> 00:24:48,414
such a response would obviously take just as long to reach us

408
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:51,160
as it took the Arecibo Message to reach them.

409
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:55,865
Based on the most recent measurements of the distance between the Solar System and M13,

410
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,880
the earliest possible date we can expect a reply

411
00:24:58,904 --> 00:25:02,463
is the year 50370.

412
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:05,200
Don't forget to mark your calendars.

413
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,689
There are even more hopelessly optimistic scenarios,

414
00:25:09,714 --> 00:25:14,389
like a star or spaceship crossing paths with the signal somewhere along the way.

415
00:25:14,414 --> 00:25:17,563
But the odds of that happening are so vanishingly small

416
00:25:17,588 --> 00:25:19,477
it might as well be impossible.

417
00:25:19,502 --> 00:25:21,595
Not least of all because, as you can see,

418
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,498
M13 is actually floating far above the galactic disc,

419
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:28,585
and there's a whole lot of nothing in between.

420
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,788
But, once again, these astronomical improbabilities

421
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:42,692
were not enough to allay concerns of an alien invasion.

422
00:25:42,717 --> 00:25:46,547
A prominent radio astronomer in Britain at the time, Sir Martin Ryle,

423
00:25:46,572 --> 00:25:50,376
feared the Arecibo Message might attract a more advanced civilization

424
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,324
seeking to colonize the Earth and mine its resources.

425
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:57,994
He took issue with the fact that a small group of people had transmitted a message

426
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:00,114
that could endanger all of humanity,

427
00:26:00,139 --> 00:26:04,960
and called for an international discussion in advance of any future transmissions.

428
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,096
While these concerns largely fell on deaf ears at the time,

429
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,379
Ryle was far from the only one urging caution.

430
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,037
By the mid-1970s, NASA was gearing up to launch two spacecraft

431
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,364
known as Voyager 1 and 2.

432
00:26:48,388 --> 00:26:50,397
Much like the Pioneer probes before them,

433
00:26:50,421 --> 00:26:54,458
the Voyager twins would be slingshot into deep space by granddaddy Jupiter

434
00:26:54,483 --> 00:26:56,900
on their way to explore the outer Solar System.

435
00:26:56,925 --> 00:26:59,128
Due to the similarity between the two programs

436
00:26:59,153 --> 00:27:02,176
and the public interest generated by the Pioneer Plaques,

437
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:05,262
NASA engineer John Casani thought a similar message

438
00:27:05,287 --> 00:27:07,517
ought to be carried by the Voyagers.

439
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,730
When Casani reached out to Carl Sagan in late 1976,

440
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:13,976
he jumped at the chance to scribe another cosmic postcard.

441
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:18,039
But this time, he wanted to impress upon the recipients not just how we think,

442
00:27:18,064 --> 00:27:19,891
but also how we feel.

443
00:27:19,915 --> 00:27:22,376
After consulting numerous people on how to proceed,

444
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,468
two propositions stood above the rest: music and pictures.

445
00:27:27,142 --> 00:27:30,560
Sagan was partial to music while fellow astronomer Frank Drake

446
00:27:30,585 --> 00:27:34,395
thought nothing could capture the human condition like a series of photographs.

447
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,847
After some additional brainstorming, it was Drake who finally realized

448
00:27:37,872 --> 00:27:41,735
they could accommodate both ideas using a phonograph record.

449
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,464
A phonograph record is an analog storage medium,

450
00:27:44,489 --> 00:27:47,208
primarily used to record and replay sound.

451
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:51,957
To record, you simply press a needle against the surface of a slow-spinning disc.

452
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:54,941
By generating a sound, like strumming a guitar...

453
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:59,499
...the needle will start to vibrate as it carves a thin

454
00:27:59,524 --> 00:28:02,023
undulating groove into the disc.

455
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:04,975
To replay the sound, you simply create a copy of the disc

456
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,096
using a less malleable material,

457
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,285
place the needle back at the beginning of the groove,

458
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:11,238
and spin the disc back up again.

459
00:28:11,263 --> 00:28:12,695
As the needle collides with the

460
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,535
hundreds of microscopic indentations in the groove,

461
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:19,087
it generates the same vibrations used to create it.

462
00:28:19,112 --> 00:28:23,544
When those vibrations reach your ears, you'll hear a guitar being strummed.

463
00:28:25,518 --> 00:28:28,248
The process is a bit more complicated in practice, of course,

464
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,055
but honestly, not by much.

465
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,522
Whether it's a single vibrating guitar string

466
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:36,315
or the deafening crescendo of an entire orchestra,

467
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:41,036
all of it can be recorded and replayed by tiny bumps in a grove.

468
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,977
Yes, magic is real, and this is it.

469
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,799
But what about the photographs?

470
00:28:46,823 --> 00:28:51,707
How do you get visual information onto a storage medium made for sound?

471
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:54,078
It's surprisingly simple, actually.

472
00:28:54,103 --> 00:28:56,783
Remember how the Arecibo Message painted a picture

473
00:28:56,808 --> 00:29:00,861
by treating black and white squares as two different frequencies?

474
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:03,074
I mean, it would be a bit concerning if you don't.

475
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:06,368
That was just 12 minutes ago. You better get that checked out.

476
00:29:06,393 --> 00:29:09,957
Anyway, they basically did that, but instead of just two frequencies,

477
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,896
they used a whole range of them.

478
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,011
Take a gradient like this, for instance.

479
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:16,366
If we assign a low frequency to black...

480
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,860
...and a high frequency to white...

481
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,651
...then every shade of gray in between

482
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:24,541
will be mapped to a corresponding frequency of sound.

483
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,819
With that translation scheme in mind,

484
00:29:38,831 --> 00:29:41,656
converting an entire photograph becomes trivial.

485
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,373
For instance, this is a black-and-white image of Mercury that's actually on the record.

486
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:49,351
All we have to do is scan every pixel in this image,

487
00:29:49,376 --> 00:29:51,745
one by one, column by column,

488
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:55,355
and translate every shade of gray into its audible equivalent.

489
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:10,466
Once we've translated every frequency of light into a frequency of sound,

490
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:12,961
we end up with a brief sample of incoherent noise

491
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:16,224
that acts like an acoustic fingerprint of the image.

492
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,936
Again, I'm simplifying a lot here, and the actual process used analog signals

493
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,136
rather than quantized pixel values, but it gives you a rough idea of how it was done.

494
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,342
Some photographs were actually recorded three times in a row

495
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:36,236
using filters for red, green, and blue.

496
00:30:36,261 --> 00:30:38,203
When recombined in just the right way,

497
00:30:38,228 --> 00:30:40,670
they produce an image full of vibrant colors,

498
00:30:40,695 --> 00:30:43,620
even though, individually, they're all black and white.

499
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:45,416
Again, magic is real.

500
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,698
In an effort to save space, they also recorded

501
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:51,698
two simultaneous streams of images into the same groove.

502
00:30:51,723 --> 00:30:54,920
This was accomplished by using the side-to-side motion of the needle

503
00:30:54,945 --> 00:30:56,402
to record one stream,

504
00:30:56,427 --> 00:30:59,477
and the up-and-down motion to record another.

505
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:04,996
The end result was this echoey stereo sound of two image streams playing at once.

506
00:31:22,137 --> 00:31:24,539
To provide the aliens with the best possible chance

507
00:31:24,564 --> 00:31:27,965
of decoding this cryptic disc of gold-plated copper,

508
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,376
the record's aluminum cover was engraved with some basic instructions.

509
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,869
First of all, the pulsar map makes a return,

510
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:39,497
and so, too, does the diagram showing the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen.

511
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,907
The latter of which is, once again, used to establish

512
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:44,803
a shared unit of both time and length.

513
00:31:44,828 --> 00:31:47,903
Near the top left, we find an overhead view of the record

514
00:31:47,928 --> 00:31:50,276
circumscribed by a binary number.

515
00:31:50,301 --> 00:31:54,465
It's telling the aliens to spin the record about five billion times faster

516
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,560
than the hyperfine transition period.

517
00:31:56,585 --> 00:32:01,885
In human terms, that's equivalent to roughly one rotation every 3.6 seconds.

518
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,867
To ensure the aliens have something with which to play the record,

519
00:32:04,892 --> 00:32:08,097
a ceramic cartridge holding a diamond-tipped needle

520
00:32:08,122 --> 00:32:10,127
was attached to the mounting bracket.

521
00:32:10,152 --> 00:32:13,697
An outline of this cartridge has also been drawn along the right edge here

522
00:32:13,722 --> 00:32:16,536
to indicate the playback starting position.

523
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,496
Underneath the overhead view, there's also a side view,

524
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,859
accompanied by another binary number.

525
00:32:21,883 --> 00:32:24,592
This time, it's telling the aliens how long it takes to play

526
00:32:24,617 --> 00:32:28,536
one full side of the record, which is about 54 minutes.

527
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,463
Moving on to the top right, we find a step-by-step guide

528
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,095
for decoding the images.

529
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,068
The waveform at the very top corresponds to three vertical slices

530
00:32:37,093 --> 00:32:38,760
of the record's first image,

531
00:32:38,785 --> 00:32:40,681
while the zigzag pattern underneath

532
00:32:40,705 --> 00:32:45,033
means the slices are meant to be stacked side-by-side, one after the other.

533
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,947
As we already know, this angelic symphony of beeps and buzzings

534
00:32:57,972 --> 00:32:59,946
are mapped to different shades of gray

535
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,618
according to a very specific translation scheme.

536
00:33:02,643 --> 00:33:04,852
A scheme the aliens are meant to reverse engineer

537
00:33:04,877 --> 00:33:07,336
with the help of these binary numbers.

538
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,514
There are three slices labeled 1, 2, 3,

539
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:13,840
and each one corresponds to roughly 8 milliseconds of audio.

540
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:16,775
A full image is 512 slices wide

541
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,005
and should form a rectangular shape with a 4:3 aspect ratio.

542
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,270
Simple as that.

543
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:25,882
On the off-chance that the aliens should somehow be

544
00:33:25,907 --> 00:33:28,590
confused by these crystal clear instructions,

545
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:31,703
the record's first image has also been outlined here at the bottom

546
00:33:31,728 --> 00:33:35,416
to show them what it's supposed to look like when properly decoded.

547
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,341
In fact, this calibration circle is the very first piece of data

548
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:41,256
the aliens would find on the record.

549
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,336
It's followed by more than a hundred images, starting with some basic math,

550
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,347
units of measurement, and a speedrun of the human experience.

551
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,941
The sequence ends with this image of a violin floating above a page of musical notation.

552
00:34:03,966 --> 00:34:07,976
It shows the beginning of a somber classical piece known as Cavatina,

553
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,721
and once the image fades, legendary emcee Ludwig van Beethoven kicks off the mixtape.

554
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,286
But the minutes-long performance of Cavatina only plays for a few seconds

555
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:41,536
before it's interrupted by even more beeps and buzzings.

556
00:34:41,561 --> 00:34:43,604
You see, six additional images

557
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:46,357
were squeezed onto the record at the very last moment,

558
00:34:46,382 --> 00:34:50,599
including a written statement by then President of the United States, Jimmy Carter,

559
00:34:50,624 --> 00:34:54,501
and a tedious listing of nearly a hundred members of Congress.

560
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,056
This bureaucratic theme then segues back into audio

561
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:02,450
with a speech by then Secretary General of the United Nations, Kurt Waldheim.

562
00:35:44,573 --> 00:35:47,039
The aliens will then be treated to a series of greetings

563
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:49,585
spoken in 58 different languages.

564
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,567
This is followed by various sounds of things like weather, animals, and technology

565
00:36:41,592 --> 00:36:45,135
before the record ends with a playlist of nearly 90 minutes of music

566
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,136
covering a vast array of instruments, styles, and cultures.

567
00:36:49,161 --> 00:36:51,778
It starts about halfway through the A side of the record

568
00:36:51,803 --> 00:36:54,421
with an uplifting composition by Johann Bach.

569
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:17,297
After another nine tracks, including a famous American rock single and

570
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:19,787
many obscure folk songs from around the world,

571
00:37:19,812 --> 00:37:24,693
the music picks up again on the record's B side with another banger by Johann Bach.

572
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,211
After nearly an hour's worth of additional music from countries like

573
00:37:39,235 --> 00:37:43,658
Germany, Peru, Russia, China, and India, just to name a few,

574
00:37:43,683 --> 00:37:49,537
the Golden Record comes to a somnific end with a full rendition of Beethoven's Cavatina

575
00:38:30,573 --> 00:38:32,609
Nearly half a century later,

576
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:36,927
Voyager 1 is now the most distant spacecraft ever launched.

577
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:40,660
Even though it was preceded by the Pioneer probes by several years

578
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,016
and even its own twin by two weeks,

579
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,867
Voyager 1 attained a greater escape velocity and has since overtaken them all.

580
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:51,863
Amazingly, both Voyagers are still transmitting to this day,

581
00:38:51,888 --> 00:38:55,236
although they're fast approaching their operational limits.

582
00:38:55,261 --> 00:38:57,734
Once they go offline and fall out of range,

583
00:38:57,759 --> 00:38:59,893
they'll join their pioneering brethren

584
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:04,439
in a timeless and destinationless trek between the stars.

585
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:09,896
Because the interstellar medium is sparsely populated with tiny dust particles,

586
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,678
the exposed surfaces of both the Pioneer Plaques

587
00:39:12,703 --> 00:39:15,496
and the Golden Records will erode over time.

588
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,018
While the former is somewhat protected by its inward-facing placement,

589
00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:21,418
it's still exposed to the vacuum of space.

590
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,330
On the other hand, the Golden Records are

591
00:39:23,355 --> 00:39:26,146
firmly pressed up against the body of the spacecraft.

592
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:28,899
According to one estimate, the outward-facing B side

593
00:39:28,924 --> 00:39:31,566
could survive for at least a few billion years,

594
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:35,304
whereas the lifespan of the concealed A side is anyone's guess.

595
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:40,632
It's not impossible that many tens or even hundreds of billions of years from now,

596
00:39:40,657 --> 00:39:46,035
all the photographs, greetings, and one third of the music will still be intact.

597
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:50,763
While the response to the Golden Records was overwhelmingly positive,

598
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,242
they did nonetheless receive a bit of criticism.

599
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:56,319
Much like before, some people were completely undeterred

600
00:39:56,344 --> 00:39:58,726
by the near-impossibility of interception

601
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:02,456
and feared the Voyagers might attract a hostile intelligence.

602
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,012
Others focused more on the contents of the message

603
00:40:05,037 --> 00:40:09,825
because they felt it was disingenuous to paint humanity in such a positive light

604
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,335
when war, crime, and cruelty

605
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:17,552
are as much a part of the human condition as music, sports, and science.

606
00:40:17,577 --> 00:40:21,590
As one of the makers of the record, Jon Lomberg, so succinctly points out...

607
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,036
The decision to exclude the uglier sides of humanity was

608
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:34,530
partly to avoid potential backlash from people here on Earth,

609
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:39,486
but also an attempt to make us seem less hostile to any future recipients.

610
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:42,029
While a mushroom cloud does convey a

611
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:44,742
shameful yet significant part of who we are,

612
00:40:44,767 --> 00:40:47,470
it could also be perceived as a threat.

613
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,358
On the other hand, the exclusion of such imagery

614
00:40:50,383 --> 00:40:52,425
could, by itself, be quite revealing

615
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,591
as we expose our casual willingness to deceive

616
00:40:55,616 --> 00:40:57,485
through tactful omission.

617
00:40:57,509 --> 00:41:02,081
Dating profiles, job interviews, meeting someone for the first time.

618
00:41:02,106 --> 00:41:05,362
I don't know if this is what the Golden Records team had in mind, but

619
00:41:05,387 --> 00:41:09,330
being selective with the truth to make a good first impression,

620
00:41:09,355 --> 00:41:11,515
how terribly human of them.

621
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:16,340
The three initiatives mentioned so far

622
00:41:16,365 --> 00:41:18,947
are likely to be the only ones you've heard of before.

623
00:41:18,972 --> 00:41:22,856
The Pioneer Plaques, the Arecibo Message, and especially the Golden Records

624
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,896
generated immense public interest at the time and remain well known to this day.

625
00:41:27,921 --> 00:41:30,466
But our attempts to communicate with life beyond

626
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:32,659
did not end with the Golden Records.

627
00:41:32,684 --> 00:41:36,571
In fact, just a few years later, the silence was broken yet again,

628
00:41:36,596 --> 00:41:38,908
and this time, the target was so close,

629
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:42,206
the minimum response time was measured not in eons

630
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:43,487
but decades.

631
00:41:53,498 --> 00:41:57,506
In early 1983, Japanese publishing company Shueisha

632
00:41:57,538 --> 00:42:00,199
was looking for ways to commemorate the 15th anniversary

633
00:42:00,224 --> 00:42:03,028
of their most popular manga anthology magazine,

634
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:05,212
known as Weekly Shōnen Jump.

635
00:42:05,237 --> 00:42:08,919
Due to the recent success of the film E.T. by Steven Spielberg,

636
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:12,601
and the fact that 1983 had been declared the World Communications Year

637
00:42:12,626 --> 00:42:14,060
by the United Nations,

638
00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:17,736
they decided to launch a competition dubbed Call to the Cosmos.

639
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,713
The price was a trip across the Pacific

640
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:23,170
to visit a large radio telescope in Stanford, California,

641
00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:25,236
from which a message would be transmitted

642
00:42:25,261 --> 00:42:26,830
to a nearby star system.

643
00:42:26,855 --> 00:42:31,416
To win, all you had to do was submit a proposal for what the message should say.

644
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,122
With a readership in the millions, the magazine received

645
00:42:34,147 --> 00:42:37,663
nearly 50 000 message ideas from children across the country.

646
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,250
These were then compiled into one abbreviated message,

647
00:42:40,274 --> 00:42:43,976
and 15 lucky winners were selected to tag along on the trip.

648
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,104
For the selection of a transmission target,

649
00:42:46,116 --> 00:42:48,376
the organizers turned to two radio astronomers

650
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,717
named Masaki Morimoto and Hisashi Hirabayashi.

651
00:42:51,742 --> 00:42:53,910
They eventually chose the star Altair

652
00:42:53,935 --> 00:42:56,703
because it's very bright and relatively close.

653
00:42:57,096 --> 00:43:00,493
It was also selected because the message was planned to be transmitted

654
00:43:00,518 --> 00:43:03,639
during an annual Japanese festival known as Tanabata

655
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,660
which celebrates the meeting of two celestial deities

656
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:10,323
represented by the stars Vega and Altair.

657
00:43:10,348 --> 00:43:13,966
Furthermore, Morimoto and Hirabayashi were asked to create their own message,

658
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,741
and after three days of work, they came up with this.

659
00:43:16,766 --> 00:43:21,178
A sequence of 13 bitmaps measuring 71x71 pixels

660
00:43:21,202 --> 00:43:24,216
that were clearly inspired by the Arecibo Message.

661
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,527
The first four images depict things like natural numbers,

662
00:43:27,551 --> 00:43:30,650
prime numbers, basic math, common elements,

663
00:43:32,165 --> 00:43:33,521
the Solar System,

664
00:43:34,607 --> 00:43:36,933
and essential building blocks of DNA.

665
00:43:38,406 --> 00:43:40,828
The next eight illustrate the evolution of life

666
00:43:40,853 --> 00:43:43,360
from simple organisms to jellyfish,

667
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:45,407
fish,

668
00:43:46,517 --> 00:43:47,610
amphibians,

669
00:43:48,405 --> 00:43:49,552
dinosaurs,

670
00:43:50,591 --> 00:43:52,045
apparently not Bigfoot,

671
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:54,026
a family of humans,

672
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,205
and a close-up of a woman's face.

673
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:59,614
The final bitmap depicts a crude illustration

674
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:01,461
of the Stanford radio telescope

675
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:05,358
alongside information like its radius, wavelength of the transmission,

676
00:44:05,383 --> 00:44:07,896
and total number of bits in the message.

677
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,445
We also find the word "TOAST" written in plain English.

678
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:13,685
According to Hirabayashi, during the three-day stint

679
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:16,097
when he and Morimoto conceived of these images,

680
00:44:16,122 --> 00:44:18,940
they weren't necessarily sober the whole way through.

681
00:44:18,965 --> 00:44:22,159
This may or may not have influenced their decision to include

682
00:44:22,184 --> 00:44:24,686
the Japanese and English word for "TOAST"

683
00:44:24,711 --> 00:44:28,799
equated to the chemical formula for ethanol.

684
00:44:28,824 --> 00:44:32,136
Because Weekly Shōnen Jump targets a very young demographic,

685
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,236
the magazine tried to clean this up a bit

686
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:36,994
by reframing what was clearly an afterthought

687
00:44:37,018 --> 00:44:39,491
by two half-drunk astronomers as...

688
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,943
Nevertheless, for about an hour on August 15, 1983,

689
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:51,309
the 13 bitmaps and an audio recording of the abridged fan-submitted greetings

690
00:44:51,334 --> 00:44:53,335
were beamed towards Altair.

691
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:40,515
Altair is among the brightest stars in the night sky,

692
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:43,115
and at a distance of less than 17 lightyears,

693
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,540
it's only, what, a few quadrillion stone throws away?

694
00:45:46,565 --> 00:45:50,770
In fact, Altair is so cosmically close that enough time has now passed

695
00:45:50,795 --> 00:45:54,189
for the transmission to have made a full round trip.

696
00:45:54,214 --> 00:45:58,183
That is to say, the message reached Altair back around the millennium shift,

697
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:02,395
and we could have received a reply as early as 2017.

698
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,153
Now, the fact that we never did does not necessarily mean there's nobody home.

699
00:46:07,178 --> 00:46:09,722
Perhaps they missed the brief 60-minute window

700
00:46:09,747 --> 00:46:11,935
when the message swept across their system?

701
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,693
Perhaps they did pick it up, but they're still drafting a response?

702
00:46:15,718 --> 00:46:19,045
Perhaps they took one quick look at Earth and humanity, and were like...

703
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:25,180
While all of these scenarios are, of course, equally probable,

704
00:46:25,205 --> 00:46:28,132
the most equal is, unfortunately, the first one.

705
00:46:28,157 --> 00:46:31,845
Not only have astronomers failed to detect a planet around Altair, but

706
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:36,409
even if one does exist, the star's only been around for about 100 million years.

707
00:46:36,434 --> 00:46:40,323
Compare that to a 4.6 billion-year veteran like the Sun,

708
00:46:40,348 --> 00:46:42,263
and things start to look a bit bleak.

709
00:46:42,288 --> 00:46:45,130
Sure, there's always the possibility that intelligent life

710
00:46:45,155 --> 00:46:48,208
typically evolves much faster than it did here on Earth,

711
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:51,671
but we currently have no good reason to think that's the case.

712
00:46:51,696 --> 00:46:55,224
But it gets worse because even if the Altairians did respond,

713
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:58,704
the odds of us even noticing are extremely remote

714
00:46:58,729 --> 00:47:03,044
because telescopes are expensive, in low supply, and high demand.

715
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:07,773
Sacrificing years, months, or even just days worth of observation time

716
00:47:07,798 --> 00:47:13,336
to screen a single planetless star for alien signals ain't exactly top priority.

717
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,073
It wasn't until the summer of 2023

718
00:47:16,098 --> 00:47:18,594
that a team led by astronomer Shin-ya Narusawa

719
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:22,223
secured a brief time slot at the Usuda Deep Space Center in Japan

720
00:47:22,248 --> 00:47:25,450
to search for a belated response to the Altair Message.

721
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:29,256
Scheduled once again to coincide with the annual Tanabata festival,

722
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,648
the search began late in the evening on August 22

723
00:47:32,673 --> 00:47:35,424
and lasted for a grand total of 60...

724
00:47:36,171 --> 00:47:37,218
...minutes.

725
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,272
Remaining optimistic, Narusawa told reporters the following morning

726
00:47:41,297 --> 00:47:44,587
that they wouldn't immediately know if an alien signal had been detected

727
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:48,937
because it would take a long time to analyze the terabytes of collected data.

728
00:47:48,962 --> 00:47:53,515
But given the lack of updates since then, I wouldn't keep my hopes up on this one.

729
00:47:55,595 --> 00:47:58,936
If nothing else, the Message to Altair was received loud and clear

730
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,287
by thousands of children across Japan.

731
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:04,460
In fact, Call to the Cosmos seems to have had a bit of a rippling effect

732
00:48:04,485 --> 00:48:07,945
because a whole series of messages designed by Japanese children

733
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:11,217
would later be transmitted for several years in a row.

734
00:48:11,242 --> 00:48:12,632
But before we get to all that,

735
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:16,816
we're gonna take a brief detour into the dazzling world of censorship.

736
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,643
As mentioned before, when the public became aware

737
00:48:26,668 --> 00:48:31,505
that NASA had bolted a plaque to the side of Pioneer 10, not everyone approved.

738
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:34,456
But it wasn't just about the risk of attracting dangerous aliens.

739
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,456
It was also about modesty.

740
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,993
You see, some people were absolutely mortified

741
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:44,435
to learn that the plaques featured line drawings of two naked humans

742
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:48,056
engaged in the scandalous act of standing there.

743
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,732
As amusing as that is, the controversy surrounding the plaques' nudity

744
00:49:24,757 --> 00:49:27,211
has been somewhat exaggerated over the years.

745
00:49:27,236 --> 00:49:31,617
These puritanical takes were "muted and few", to quote Carl Sagan,

746
00:49:31,642 --> 00:49:35,616
and it's genuinely difficult to find examples like the one you just heard.

747
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:37,865
There were a handful of reductive headlines,

748
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:41,363
and some newspapers opted for the Barbie- and Ken-doll treatment, but

749
00:49:41,388 --> 00:49:44,817
the vast majority published the full uncensored image and

750
00:49:44,842 --> 00:49:46,549
barely even mentioned the couple.

751
00:49:46,574 --> 00:49:50,248
In fact, some criticized the plaques not for showing the human form,

752
00:49:50,273 --> 00:49:51,939
but for not showing enough.

753
00:49:51,964 --> 00:49:54,060
More specifically, people took issue with the complete

754
00:49:54,085 --> 00:49:56,494
absence of visible female genitalia,

755
00:49:56,519 --> 00:49:59,816
considering that no such neutering had been applied to the man.

756
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,931
It's unclear if the lack of anatomical detail on the lower half of the woman

757
00:50:03,956 --> 00:50:08,980
was demanded by prudish NASA officials, or a decision made by the Sagans themselves.

758
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:12,376
Conflicting accounts makes it difficult to know exactly who's to blame.

759
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,671
Nevertheless, when it came time to select material

760
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:16,998
for the Golden Records a few years later,

761
00:50:17,023 --> 00:50:18,782
these concerns flared up again.

762
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,256
Fearing a repeat of the previous debacle,

763
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,407
NASA religiously vetted every song, soundbite, and image

764
00:50:24,432 --> 00:50:26,483
that Sagan and co sought to include.

765
00:50:26,495 --> 00:50:28,764
They ultimately rejected a nude photograph

766
00:50:28,789 --> 00:50:30,801
of a young man and pregnant woman

767
00:50:30,825 --> 00:50:34,616
intended to show both human anatomy and procreation.

768
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,461
The reason I'm bringing this up is because, in 1986,

769
00:50:37,485 --> 00:50:39,914
an American artist by the name of Joe Davis

770
00:50:39,939 --> 00:50:42,346
decided to fight back against all this pearl-clutching

771
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:45,033
with a project known as Poetica Vaginal.

772
00:50:45,058 --> 00:50:47,976
With the help of a few ballerinas and other volunteers,

773
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,177
Davis used a custom-made device to record...

774
00:50:51,202 --> 00:50:52,637
...how do I put this...

775
00:50:52,661 --> 00:50:55,810
...contractions from within the female reproductive system.

776
00:50:55,835 --> 00:50:59,917
Those pressure oscillations were then artistically manipulated

777
00:50:59,942 --> 00:51:02,727
to create something that's meant to resemble human speech.

778
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,636
After obtaining access to a radio telescope

779
00:51:17,648 --> 00:51:20,113
near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,

780
00:51:20,138 --> 00:51:23,218
Davis and his team began transmitting the sounds into space.

781
00:51:23,855 --> 00:51:27,059
However, the broadcast only lasted for about 15 to 20 minutes

782
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:30,372
before the project was prematurely terminated by an Air Force Colonel,

783
00:51:30,397 --> 00:51:32,750
who was apparently overseeing the facility.

784
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,877
Nevertheless, according to Davis,

785
00:51:34,902 --> 00:51:38,259
those few minutes were enough to transmit brief snippets of audio

786
00:51:38,284 --> 00:51:40,468
to each of the four selected targets.

787
00:51:41,216 --> 00:51:44,270
Two of them were never publicly identified, as far as I can tell,

788
00:51:44,295 --> 00:51:48,128
while the other two are known as Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti.

789
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,736
Epsilon Eridani is home to one confirmed planet

790
00:51:51,761 --> 00:51:54,670
with a mass nearly identical to that of Jupiter.

791
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,515
While additional planets could exist,

792
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,520
including ones that resemble Earth,

793
00:51:58,545 --> 00:52:01,699
Eridani is a relative newcomer to the Milky Way family

794
00:52:01,724 --> 00:52:04,452
at approximately half a billion years young.

795
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,561
On the other hand, Tau Ceti is certifiably ancient.

796
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:12,761
Its precise age remains unclear, but it's definitely older than the Sun

797
00:52:12,785 --> 00:52:16,412
and home to not just one, but four confirmed planets.

798
00:52:16,437 --> 00:52:19,105
On top of that, there's a slim chance that two of them

799
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:22,966
are grazing the inner and outer bounds of the habitable zone.

800
00:52:22,991 --> 00:52:24,885
That being the distance from the star

801
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:29,289
at which water could remain liquid on the surface of an earthlike planet.

802
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:34,154
Unfortunately, both of these stars are surrounded by immense belts of debris,

803
00:52:34,179 --> 00:52:37,706
not unlike the Asteroid and Kuiper belts in the Solar System.

804
00:52:37,731 --> 00:52:40,616
The difference is that Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti

805
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:43,829
retain asteroidal and cometary populations

806
00:52:43,854 --> 00:52:47,256
many times greater than what currently orbits the Sun.

807
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,175
While this makes perfect sense for a youngster like Eridani,

808
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,112
it's a lot more concerning for a galactic grandparent like Tau Ceti.

809
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:57,642
It implies that something is either preventing that material from

810
00:52:57,667 --> 00:53:00,792
coalescing into planets across billions of years

811
00:53:00,817 --> 00:53:04,694
or that the system has suffered a recent cascade of instability.

812
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:08,664
In either case, more stuff almost certainly means more impact events

813
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:11,598
like the one that nearly wiped out the dinosaurs.

814
00:53:11,623 --> 00:53:15,330
But even if we optimistically assume that none of that's a problem,

815
00:53:15,355 --> 00:53:19,394
the mass and size of the planets orbiting Tau Ceti are highly uncertain.

816
00:53:19,419 --> 00:53:22,039
There's a good chance they have less in common with Earth

817
00:53:22,064 --> 00:53:24,392
and more so with Uranus and Neptune.

818
00:53:24,416 --> 00:53:26,216
But even if that isn't the case,

819
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,028
the chemical makeup of Tau Ceti appears to be quite different from the Sun,

820
00:53:30,053 --> 00:53:32,469
suggesting its planets are composed of materials

821
00:53:32,494 --> 00:53:35,523
quite different from those that spawned life in the Solar System.

822
00:53:35,957 --> 00:53:38,657
In summary, it's not looking great.

823
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,461
Now, it may seem pointless to consider the habitability of these distant worlds

824
00:53:44,486 --> 00:53:49,025
when the message we sent towards them is completely indecipherable.

825
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:52,250
I mean, if you thought the aliens were gonna struggle with the Golden Records,

826
00:53:52,275 --> 00:53:54,788
good luck to them figuring this out.

827
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:05,060
But just like the Arecibo Message, the artificial nature of the signal

828
00:54:05,085 --> 00:54:07,066
is a message in and of itself.

829
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,952
If you want to believe there's a naturally occurring phenomenon

830
00:54:09,977 --> 00:54:12,277
capable of producing the exact same radio waves

831
00:54:12,302 --> 00:54:15,921
as those emitted by Joe Davis and his team back in 1986,

832
00:54:15,946 --> 00:54:17,346
you go right ahead.

833
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:20,671
But somehow, I have my doubts about that.

834
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:30,921
Presuming the message was received and correctly identified as a technosignature,

835
00:54:30,946 --> 00:54:35,045
we could've received a reply from the Eridanians as early as 2007

836
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:38,333
or the Cetinites as early as 2010.

837
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,423
I did some checking and regretfully have to inform you

838
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:44,146
that humanity's been ghosted once again.

839
00:54:52,449 --> 00:54:54,816
About a decade after the Message to Altair,

840
00:54:54,841 --> 00:54:57,522
the National Space Development Agency of Japan

841
00:54:57,547 --> 00:55:00,719
began hosting an annual space camp event for young children

842
00:55:00,744 --> 00:55:02,616
known as the Cosmic College.

843
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,827
Students could choose from a bunch of different activities

844
00:55:04,852 --> 00:55:06,408
over the course of multiple days,

845
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:09,967
including a class on how to write and send interstellar messages.

846
00:55:09,992 --> 00:55:13,267
In fact, one of the astronomers invited to lecture at these events

847
00:55:13,292 --> 00:55:18,536
was none other than Hisashi Hirabayashi, one of the creators of the Altair Message.

848
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,079
But it wasn't just a theoretical exercise.

849
00:55:21,103 --> 00:55:25,527
NASDA actually arranged for some of those messages to be transmitted into space.

850
00:55:25,552 --> 00:55:28,962
Once a year between at least 1995 and 1998,

851
00:55:28,987 --> 00:55:32,677
simple bitmap images measuring 11x11 pixels

852
00:55:32,702 --> 00:55:37,736
were sent from the Usuda Deep Space Center to various locations across the galaxy.

853
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,807
These transmissions received next to no publicity at the time

854
00:55:40,832 --> 00:55:43,452
and are virtually unknown to this day.

855
00:55:43,477 --> 00:55:47,560
This makes it difficult to know exactly what was sent where and when.

856
00:55:47,585 --> 00:55:48,722
Here's what we do know.

857
00:55:48,747 --> 00:55:52,136
The first Cosmic College was held in August 1995,

858
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,897
during which this image of two parents and a child

859
00:55:54,922 --> 00:55:59,328
was beamed towards some unknown destination within the constellation Libra.

860
00:55:59,353 --> 00:56:03,336
Even less is known about this image of an alien holding hands with a human,

861
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,138
transmitted sometime in August 1996.

862
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:09,228
This time, we don't even know the general region of the sky

863
00:56:09,252 --> 00:56:11,416
to which it might have been sent.

864
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:17,441
In August 1997, two bitmaps were beamed towards a binary star system known as Spica.

865
00:56:17,466 --> 00:56:19,632
The first image depicts a smiley face,

866
00:56:19,657 --> 00:56:22,725
while the other shows a Japanese dumpling known as a dango

867
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,777
next to a steaming cup of tea.

868
00:56:24,802 --> 00:56:27,514
Unfortunately, Spica is a ticking time bomb

869
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:31,256
because the two stars are expected to slowly encroach upon one another,

870
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,940
which could trigger a supernova at some point in the future.

871
00:56:34,965 --> 00:56:38,892
Even if that wasn't the case, they're far too young to host an earthlike planet,

872
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:42,177
and even if that wasn't the case, it would take another five centuries for

873
00:56:42,202 --> 00:56:43,896
any replies to reach us.

874
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,318
Finally, this image that simply says 1 + 1 = 2

875
00:56:47,343 --> 00:56:51,816
was transmitted to some unknown location in August 1998.

876
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,089
Now, there could be more of these transmissions that have been lost to time.

877
00:56:55,114 --> 00:56:58,382
For instance, an image of a leaf to symbolize the nature of Earth

878
00:56:58,407 --> 00:57:01,908
appears to have been designed during the Cosmic College of 1999.

879
00:57:01,933 --> 00:57:05,801
But I couldn't find any information on whether it was actually beamed into space.

880
00:57:07,118 --> 00:57:11,334
While competitions, art projects, and recreational programs

881
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,895
certainly could generate an alien response,

882
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,314
their primary function is to elicit a response from us down here on Earth.

883
00:57:18,339 --> 00:57:22,456
They're inspiring, provocative, and generally attract a lot of attention.

884
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,476
So it was only a matter of time before someone came along

885
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,148
and began charging a fee.

886
00:57:37,025 --> 00:57:40,567
In early 1998, American entrepreneur Charles Chafer

887
00:57:40,592 --> 00:57:44,173
announced a commercial venture known as Encounter 2001.

888
00:57:44,198 --> 00:57:48,275
The project sought to crowdfund the launch of a tiny light-sailing spacecraft

889
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:52,040
that wouldcarry samples of human DNA beyond the Solar System.

890
00:57:52,065 --> 00:57:55,003
For only $50, anyone could submit a few strands of hair

891
00:57:55,028 --> 00:57:57,258
along with a brief message and their portrait

892
00:57:57,282 --> 00:58:00,139
and join the so-called Millennial Voyage.

893
00:58:00,164 --> 00:58:02,191
Market analysis by Chafer and his team

894
00:58:02,215 --> 00:58:06,590
projected sales of anywhere between 1.5 and 4.5 million tickets

895
00:58:06,614 --> 00:58:08,157
before the launch date.

896
00:58:08,182 --> 00:58:10,616
If those figures seem a bit optimistic,

897
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,140
they were nothing compared to the expectations of their customers.

898
00:58:33,929 --> 00:58:38,215
This idea that aliens might one day use your DNA to clone your body

899
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,063
was surprisingly prevalent.

900
00:58:40,087 --> 00:58:41,553
For instance, the greeting submitted

901
00:58:41,578 --> 00:58:44,447
by renowned science fiction author Sir Arthur C. Clarke

902
00:58:44,472 --> 00:58:47,233
simply read, "Fare well, my clone!"

903
00:58:47,258 --> 00:58:50,056
While the Millennial Voyage was the project's main objective,

904
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:54,056
they also promised to beam participants' greetings into space ahead of the launch

905
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,862
using a radio telescope.

906
00:58:55,887 --> 00:58:59,795
A side project that would come to be known as the Cosmic Calls.

907
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:05,088
By spring of 1999, some 43 000 people had signed up for Encounter 2001,

908
00:59:05,113 --> 00:59:10,125
including two Canadian astrophysicists named Yvan Dutil and Stéphane Dumas.

909
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:13,944
Dutil and Dumas had been given the task of creating what's known as a primer.

910
00:59:13,969 --> 00:59:18,376
A primer attempts to gradually introduce the recipients to more complex ideas

911
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,010
using some sort of step-by-step process.

912
00:59:21,034 --> 00:59:23,605
For instance, the primer of the Message to Altair

913
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:29,172
were the 13 bitmaps sent alongside the far more complicated greeting in Japanese.

914
00:59:29,197 --> 00:59:31,965
Dutil and Dumas did something similar for the Cosmic Calls.

915
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:35,137
They created a primer composed of 23 bitmaps,

916
00:59:35,162 --> 00:59:39,294
and this first one starts off by listing the ten digits of our decimal system

917
00:59:39,319 --> 00:59:43,935
using three different notations: unary, binary, and decimal.

918
00:59:44,822 --> 00:59:48,354
An idea they appear to have lifted from this image on the Golden Records,

919
00:59:48,378 --> 00:59:50,833
which did almost the exact same thing.

920
00:59:50,858 --> 00:59:54,010
But there is, of course, one very noticeable difference.

921
00:59:54,035 --> 00:59:58,490
The one from the Golden Records uses the familiar glyphs of Arabic numerals,

922
00:59:58,515 --> 01:00:03,310
whereas the primer to the Cosmic Calls uses these alien-looking symbols.

923
01:00:03,335 --> 01:00:05,908
That's because Dutil and Dumas decided to create their own

924
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:08,296
rudimentary language of sorts.

925
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,127
Now, this might seem like an odd choice

926
01:00:10,152 --> 01:00:14,296
because whether, say, a two, looks like this or like this,

927
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,787
it's not gonna make any difference to the recipients.

928
01:00:16,811 --> 01:00:20,241
But it's not about readability. It's about redundancy.

929
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:23,409
You see, there's a lot of naturally occurring radiation that could

930
01:00:23,434 --> 01:00:27,266
interfere with a radio transmission between the source and destination.

931
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:31,253
Imagine, for instance, that we transmitted fifteen bits arranged like this

932
01:00:31,278 --> 01:00:33,082
to represent the number 8.

933
01:00:33,106 --> 01:00:35,865
If this one bit in the middle was flipped along the way,

934
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:38,758
the recipients would pick up a 0 instead of an 8.

935
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:41,264
Flip this bit, and the 8 becomes a 6.

936
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:43,888
Flip these two, and it becomes a 5.

937
01:00:43,912 --> 01:00:47,576
In other words, this transmission has no redundancy whatsoever.

938
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,344
Lose one bit and the entire message could become corrupted.

939
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:54,155
The glyphs created by Dutil and Dumas were designed to be as

940
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:57,264
fault-tolerant and noise-resistant as possible.

941
01:00:57,289 --> 01:01:00,136
There are several bits of difference between all the symbols,

942
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,936
and that still holds true even if they were to be mirrored or rotated.

943
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,936
But apart from the symbolic difference,

944
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,816
the Cosmic Call primer follows a structure that should be very familiar at this point.

945
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,527
The first five pages cover various mathematical concepts that

946
01:01:15,552 --> 01:01:17,694
gradually increase in complexity.

947
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,257
The next six delve into chemistry and physics,

948
01:01:30,282 --> 01:01:32,780
including a schematic of the Solar System.

949
01:01:41,642 --> 01:01:45,652
The next eight are all about Earth, humanity, and biology,

950
01:01:45,677 --> 01:01:50,504
including a rendition of the Pioneer couple and a two-page map of the continents.

951
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:05,452
Page 21 contains information about the transmission and telescope,

952
01:02:05,477 --> 01:02:11,391
while page 22 brags about our cosmological knowledge, like the age of the universe.

953
01:02:11,416 --> 01:02:14,818
The 23rd and final page invites the aliens to respond

954
01:02:14,843 --> 01:02:16,856
by asking them a series of questions,

955
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,684
using this flower-looking glyph as a stand-in for a question mark.

956
01:02:20,709 --> 01:02:24,336
For instance, this means velocity while this means photon,

957
01:02:24,361 --> 01:02:28,190
so this question could be read as, "What is the speed of light?"

958
01:02:28,215 --> 01:02:30,727
But how could the aliens possibly know

959
01:02:30,752 --> 01:02:35,044
that these symbols mean question, velocity, and photon?

960
01:02:35,069 --> 01:02:37,927
Well, it all comes down to that first page of numbers

961
01:02:37,952 --> 01:02:40,122
to which everything else is anchored.

962
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:44,187
The aliens would start by hypothesizing that these ten symbols

963
01:02:44,212 --> 01:02:48,176
represent ten digits in a base-ten numeral system.

964
01:02:48,201 --> 01:02:49,964
With that assumption locked in place,

965
01:02:49,989 --> 01:02:54,744
they'd move on to the next page and find 1 something 1 = 2.

966
01:02:54,769 --> 01:02:58,018
Okay, so they now suspect that this symbol represents addition

967
01:02:58,043 --> 01:03:02,652
and make similar assumptions regarding subtraction, multiplication, and division.

968
01:03:02,677 --> 01:03:07,625
Once they get to page four, they would know that this reads something + 2 = 3,

969
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:10,825
while this reads something + 4 = 10.

970
01:03:10,849 --> 01:03:12,434
Given that the same symbol

971
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:15,534
is used to represent what is clearly not the same value,

972
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:19,960
they might suspect that this is a placeholder for a variable quantity.

973
01:03:19,985 --> 01:03:23,688
In other words, this variable represents something unknown,

974
01:03:23,713 --> 01:03:28,572
a bit like a question mark, emphasized by this symbol off to the left.

975
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,784
By gradually introducing new symbols alongside familiar ones

976
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,816
in such a way that logic and process of elimination

977
01:03:35,828 --> 01:03:37,330
can be used to fill in the blanks,

978
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:40,853
it creates a lot of mutual corroboration between the pages.

979
01:03:40,878 --> 01:03:45,625
By page eight, they'd be introduced to the concepts of time and length via hydrogen,

980
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:49,584
followed by velocity and photons via the speed of light.

981
01:03:50,424 --> 01:03:55,309
To be clear, there's still plenty of room for confusion and misinterpretation.

982
01:03:55,334 --> 01:03:59,335
Not least of all because a few typos did actually slip through the cracks.

983
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:02,156
For instance, according to this line on the seventh page,

984
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:07,381
uranium is said to have 116 neutrons but there is no such element.

985
01:04:07,406 --> 01:04:11,451
The lightest known isotope of uranium has 122 neutrons

986
01:04:11,476 --> 01:04:14,668
and the most abundant here on Earth has 146

987
01:04:14,693 --> 01:04:17,097
which is probably what they meant.

988
01:04:17,122 --> 01:04:19,408
But even if the primer had been flawless,

989
01:04:19,433 --> 01:04:22,023
there's only so much hand-holding one can do

990
01:04:22,047 --> 01:04:25,082
when you don't even know if the recipients have hands.

991
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,811
In addition to the primer, the language created by Dutil and Dumas

992
01:04:30,836 --> 01:04:33,869
was used to write a message about the Millennial Voyage.

993
01:04:33,894 --> 01:04:37,148
This was followed by a copy of the Arecibo Message,

994
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:40,156
greetings by the staff at Encounter 2001,

995
01:04:40,181 --> 01:04:44,961
as well as the 43 000 names and greetings from people around the world.

996
01:04:44,986 --> 01:04:48,633
With assistance from prominent Russian astronomer Alexander Zaitsev,

997
01:04:48,658 --> 01:04:50,793
Chafer and his team then obtained access to the

998
01:04:50,805 --> 01:04:53,174
Evpatoria Deep Space Center in southern Ukraine,

999
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:57,739
and the first Cosmic Call began broadcasting on May 24, 1999.

1000
01:06:00,441 --> 01:06:02,094
Unlike many other initiatives,

1001
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:05,068
which received very little attention from the press and public,

1002
01:06:05,093 --> 01:06:07,741
the Cosmic Calls were a global phenomenon.

1003
01:06:07,766 --> 01:06:10,049
In fact, the project received so much attention

1004
01:06:10,074 --> 01:06:13,304
that officials at the National Space Agency of Ukraine

1005
01:06:13,329 --> 01:06:14,749
got a bit spooked.

1006
01:06:14,774 --> 01:06:18,054
The plan was to beam the message to four nearby star systems,

1007
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,776
but after the first transmission on May 24,

1008
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,976
Ukrainian officials suddenly shut the whole thing down.

1009
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,468
According to Zaitsev, rumors had begun circulating

1010
01:06:26,493 --> 01:06:30,928
that the reason Encounter 2001 were using the Evpatoria Deep Space Center

1011
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:33,873
was because they'd been denied access to American facilities

1012
01:06:33,897 --> 01:06:37,667
out of concern it might be dangerous to transmit messages into space.

1013
01:06:37,692 --> 01:06:40,778
In reality, other radio observatories like Arecibo

1014
01:06:40,803 --> 01:06:43,619
were simply not available on the dates requested.

1015
01:06:43,644 --> 01:06:46,536
It had nothing to do with malevolent aliens.

1016
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,589
Zaitsev spent over a month explaining this to the agency

1017
01:06:49,614 --> 01:06:52,410
before Chafer and his team were allowed to resume broadcasting

1018
01:06:52,434 --> 01:06:53,986
on the last day of June.

1019
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,721
The first target was 16 Cygni A,

1020
01:06:58,746 --> 01:07:01,853
a sunlike star that's part of a ternary system.

1021
01:07:01,878 --> 01:07:04,897
In other words, it's a system of three stars with Cygni A

1022
01:07:04,922 --> 01:07:07,816
being encircled by a small red dwarf labeled C,

1023
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,900
and together, they orbit another sunlike star labeled B

1024
01:07:10,925 --> 01:07:15,332
that's nearly six times further away than Voyager 1 is from the Sun.

1025
01:07:16,106 --> 01:07:18,936
While Cygni B does have one confirmed planet,

1026
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,776
it's an enormous gas giant that patrols the entire habitable zone,

1027
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,986
making it impossible for an earthlike planet within that region

1028
01:07:26,011 --> 01:07:27,802
to maintain a stable orbit.

1029
01:07:28,575 --> 01:07:31,732
While the transmission was specifically directed at Cygni A,

1030
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:34,784
the situation doesn't improve much because, as far as we know,

1031
01:07:34,808 --> 01:07:36,622
it doesn't have any planets.

1032
01:07:36,647 --> 01:07:38,682
Instead, it's orbited by Cygni C

1033
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:42,518
at about twice the distance between the Sun and Pluto.

1034
01:07:42,543 --> 01:07:46,847
It's definitely possible for an earthlike planet to be sandwiched between them,

1035
01:07:46,872 --> 01:07:51,558
but it all comes down to the precise orbit of Cygni C, which is currently unknown.

1036
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:58,316
The second target was Gliese 746, a binary system composed of a sunlike primary

1037
01:07:58,341 --> 01:08:01,599
and a smaller companion, of which very little is known.

1038
01:08:01,624 --> 01:08:05,045
The distance between them is less than that between the Sun and Mercury,

1039
01:08:05,069 --> 01:08:07,578
so there's no chance of finding an earthlike planet

1040
01:08:07,602 --> 01:08:09,804
in a stable orbit around either one.

1041
01:08:09,829 --> 01:08:13,119
However, there is such a thing as circumbinary planets

1042
01:08:13,144 --> 01:08:15,368
that orbit two stars at once.

1043
01:08:15,392 --> 01:08:18,660
With a system as tightly bound as Gliese 746,

1044
01:08:18,685 --> 01:08:23,450
there's plenty of space for such a planet to exist, but so far, nothing.

1045
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,859
The third target was 15 Sagittae.

1046
01:08:26,883 --> 01:08:30,344
It could be described as a binary system because Sagittae A

1047
01:08:30,369 --> 01:08:33,471
is orbited by this tiny companion labeled B.

1048
01:08:33,496 --> 01:08:36,205
But Sagittae B is what's known as a brown dwarf

1049
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:39,276
that falls somewhere between a planet and a star.

1050
01:08:39,301 --> 01:08:43,829
It's dozens of times more massive than all the planets in the Solar System combined,

1051
01:08:43,854 --> 01:08:47,503
but still not quite massive enough to shine like a star.

1052
01:08:47,528 --> 01:08:50,696
Apart from Sagittae B, no other bodies have been detected,

1053
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,600
and the system is a bit on the younger side

1054
01:08:52,625 --> 01:08:55,591
at approximately two and a half billion years old.

1055
01:08:56,631 --> 01:09:00,102
Finally, the fourth target was Gliese 777 A,

1056
01:09:00,127 --> 01:09:04,419
a sunlike star that is once again encircled by a red dwarf companion.

1057
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:08,379
Except, this time, the two are separated by such an enormous distance

1058
01:09:08,404 --> 01:09:12,776
that it takes them upwards of 100 000 years to complete an orbit.

1059
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:17,798
Nevertheless, the target was 777 A, and it's home to three confirmed planets.

1060
01:09:17,823 --> 01:09:20,221
Two of them are many times more massive than Earth

1061
01:09:20,246 --> 01:09:22,110
and are practically hugging the star,

1062
01:09:22,134 --> 01:09:26,424
while the third is a bit more massive than Jupiter and is much further away.

1063
01:09:26,449 --> 01:09:28,612
In between them lies the habitable zone,

1064
01:09:28,637 --> 01:09:32,167
which does appear to be stable enough to host an earthlike planet,

1065
01:09:32,192 --> 01:09:34,737
but none have been detected to date.

1066
01:09:36,111 --> 01:09:39,416
While all of these stars are within the general solar neighborhood,

1067
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,979
we still have to wait until the 22nd century

1068
01:09:42,004 --> 01:09:45,576
until any response could relativistically be received.

1069
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,586
A fact that might come as a disappointment to some of you,

1070
01:09:48,611 --> 01:09:50,902
but no doubt a relief to others.

1071
01:10:09,065 --> 01:10:10,959
But it wasn't just the general public.

1072
01:10:10,983 --> 01:10:15,017
A growing number of experts had begun to question the ethics and wisdom

1073
01:10:15,042 --> 01:10:16,912
of deliberate communication attempts.

1074
01:10:16,937 --> 01:10:20,456
Among them was Carl Sagan, who, as early as 1983,

1075
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:24,136
began arguing in favor of "listening rather than sending."

1076
01:10:24,161 --> 01:10:26,136
Not so much because he feared invasion,

1077
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:29,354
but because he felt that contacting aliens was premature.

1078
01:10:29,379 --> 01:10:30,129
He wrote that

1079
01:10:30,154 --> 01:10:33,840
"it is not yet clear that we have anything particularly interesting to say"

1080
01:10:33,865 --> 01:10:36,961
due to what he described as our "backward status."

1081
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,733
In other words, a baby civilization like humanity

1082
01:10:40,758 --> 01:10:43,134
probably won't have much to offer one that's been around

1083
01:10:43,159 --> 01:10:45,595
for millions or billions of years,

1084
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,062
so we should prioritize intelligence gathering

1085
01:10:48,086 --> 01:10:50,502
before we start shouting at the sky.

1086
01:10:51,145 --> 01:10:55,218
But astronomers like Alexander Zaitsev strongly disagreed with that position,

1087
01:10:55,243 --> 01:10:58,841
essentially arguing that we must not give into fear of the unknown.

1088
01:10:58,866 --> 01:11:01,827
Sure enough, just a few months after the first Cosmic Call,

1089
01:11:01,852 --> 01:11:05,226
Zaitsev and others began work on yet another message.

1090
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,360
In early 2000, a youth community center in Moscow

1091
01:11:17,385 --> 01:11:20,908
was preparing to host a festival to celebrate the new millennium.

1092
01:11:20,933 --> 01:11:24,540
During the preparations, an astronomy teacher named Boris Pschenichner

1093
01:11:24,565 --> 01:11:28,077
suggested to some of his students that they should create an interstellar message

1094
01:11:28,102 --> 01:11:31,416
to be presented during a space-themed portion of the event.

1095
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,588
The project was spearheaded by two teenagers

1096
01:11:33,612 --> 01:11:36,028
named Egor Kiselev and Vladimir Filippov

1097
01:11:36,053 --> 01:11:39,976
who quickly devised a message composed of both music and pictures.

1098
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,136
Once the project had been approved by a committee that included Alexander Zaitsev,

1099
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,312
it was decided to transmit the message sometime the following year

1100
01:11:47,337 --> 01:11:50,839
to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the first crewed spaceflight

1101
01:11:50,864 --> 01:11:54,626
by cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin in 1961.

1102
01:11:54,651 --> 01:11:57,666
Zaitsev expanded upon the ideas of Kiselev and Filippov

1103
01:11:57,691 --> 01:12:01,518
by suggesting the message be divided into three distinct signal types:

1104
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:02,511
constant,

1105
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:07,812
continuous,

1106
01:12:13,603 --> 01:12:14,584
and discrete.

1107
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,816
The constant signal would be sent first

1108
01:12:22,841 --> 01:12:25,911
to let the aliens know that they've picked up something strange.

1109
01:12:25,936 --> 01:12:29,175
That probing beacon would then transition into a continuous signal

1110
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,887
conveying the musical component of the message.

1111
01:12:31,912 --> 01:12:36,465
Finally, two discrete frequencies would be used to broadcast binary-coded images.

1112
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:38,400
According to Zaitsev, the three formats

1113
01:12:38,424 --> 01:12:42,272
represented the language of nature, emotion, and logic.

1114
01:12:42,297 --> 01:12:45,120
A total of nine musical compositions were selected,

1115
01:12:45,144 --> 01:12:49,085
and Zaitsev proposed using an electronic instrument known as a theremin.

1116
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:53,552
Partly because it generates a smooth monophonic signal with minimal overtones,

1117
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:56,520
but also because the theremin was a Russian invention.

1118
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:15,176
The visual portion of the message was composed of 28 bitmaps

1119
01:13:15,201 --> 01:13:17,677
primarily designed by Kiselev and Filippov.

1120
01:13:17,702 --> 01:13:20,346
The first image depicts a wave within a circle,

1121
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:23,359
which is meant to convey to the aliens that the circle's diameter

1122
01:13:23,384 --> 01:13:26,216
is equal to the wavelength of the transmission.

1123
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,208
If they correctly make that guess,

1124
01:13:28,233 --> 01:13:30,813
the next image is meant to be scaled so that this circle

1125
01:13:30,837 --> 01:13:32,518
with a human face in the center

1126
01:13:32,543 --> 01:13:36,099
matches the diameter of the circle from the previous image.

1127
01:13:36,124 --> 01:13:38,560
Doing so would enable them to decode other components,

1128
01:13:38,585 --> 01:13:43,377
like how this wavelength corresponds to a spectral absorption line of water.

1129
01:13:43,402 --> 01:13:45,130
Without going into too much detail here,

1130
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:49,512
it's meant to highlight the significance of water to life here on Earth.

1131
01:13:49,537 --> 01:13:53,861
While some of the illustrations tried to convey information using science and logic,

1132
01:13:53,886 --> 01:13:56,662
a lot of it was artistically motivated.

1133
01:13:56,687 --> 01:13:59,868
Life inhabits the ocean, land, and atmosphere,

1134
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:02,959
represented by dolphins, humans, and birds

1135
01:14:02,984 --> 01:14:06,070
that the aliens will, of course, have no chance of deciphering.

1136
01:14:06,802 --> 01:14:09,786
The ten circles along the edge, numbered 1 through 10,

1137
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:13,166
not only symbolize our use of a base-ten numeral system,

1138
01:14:13,191 --> 01:14:16,223
but also correspond to the next ten images.

1139
01:14:16,248 --> 01:14:18,733
The first of which is this side-view of our galaxy

1140
01:14:18,758 --> 01:14:20,567
with an arrow pointing at us.

1141
01:14:20,995 --> 01:14:23,640
The second is a schematic of the Solar System.

1142
01:14:24,027 --> 01:14:25,747
The third gets a bit closer.

1143
01:14:26,393 --> 01:14:28,330
The fourth gets closer still.

1144
01:14:29,595 --> 01:14:31,121
Then there's a family,

1145
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:33,702
a house,

1146
01:14:35,835 --> 01:14:37,708
and a close-up of a person.

1147
01:14:40,014 --> 01:14:42,855
Towards the end, there's also a yin and yang symbol,

1148
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:46,234
two games of tic-tac-toe,

1149
01:14:47,826 --> 01:14:51,237
and an illustration of the telescope used to transmit the message.

1150
01:14:51,864 --> 01:14:56,142
But it doesn't end there because the next image is the same emblem we saw before,

1151
01:14:56,167 --> 01:14:58,220
except the ten outlying circles

1152
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:01,500
have now been filled in with the ten preceding images.

1153
01:15:01,525 --> 01:15:06,888
Exactly why they're laid out in this circular pattern in this particular order,

1154
01:15:06,912 --> 01:15:09,016
or even what function it all serves,

1155
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,793
I couldn't tell you.

1156
01:15:10,817 --> 01:15:15,736
But, again, the emblem was intended to be both informational and artistic.

1157
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,322
Following the emblem sequence, the next three images

1158
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:21,363
contain some text written in both Russian and English.

1159
01:15:21,388 --> 01:15:26,616
Approximately 1 000 students between the ages of 13 and 18 participated in the project,

1160
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,249
and this is an extreme abbreviation of their many proposed greetings.

1161
01:15:30,274 --> 01:15:32,191
It very innocently ends with...

1162
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,224
Signed by...

1163
01:15:37,101 --> 01:15:40,944
The final twelve bitmaps depict illustrations that we've already seen,

1164
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:45,094
each one captioned with a brief description in both Russian and English.

1165
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:47,310
They're meant to function as a sort of dictionary

1166
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:49,683
with the hopelessly optimistic goal

1167
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:53,274
of teaching the aliens how to read the aforementioned greeting.

1168
01:15:53,847 --> 01:15:57,228
The three components of the message, starting with the probing signal,

1169
01:15:57,253 --> 01:15:59,927
followed by the music, and the 28 bitmaps,

1170
01:15:59,952 --> 01:16:05,368
were then transmitted from the Evpatoria Deep Space Center on August 29, 2001.

1171
01:16:44,346 --> 01:16:46,216
Much like the first Cosmic Call,

1172
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,196
the Teenage Message was transmitted multiple times over multiple days.

1173
01:16:50,221 --> 01:16:52,616
This time to six different targets.

1174
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,873
The first one was Gliese 797 A, an as of yet planetless but sunlike star

1175
01:16:57,898 --> 01:17:02,000
that forms a wide ternary system with two smaller companions.

1176
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,336
The second target was 37 Geminorum,

1177
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,469
a solitary sunlike star that has yet to show any signs

1178
01:17:08,494 --> 01:17:10,678
of hosting a planetary system.

1179
01:17:11,344 --> 01:17:15,969
Target number three was another sunlike star known as 47 Ursae Majoris,

1180
01:17:15,994 --> 01:17:18,482
which is home to three confirmed planets.

1181
01:17:18,507 --> 01:17:21,505
They all appear to be gas giants, and the one closest to the star

1182
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:24,875
is grazing the outer edge of the habitable zone.

1183
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:27,203
Because it's more than twice the mass of Jupiter,

1184
01:17:27,228 --> 01:17:31,298
its immense gravity renders nearly the whole outer half of the habitable zone

1185
01:17:31,323 --> 01:17:32,696
completely off limits.

1186
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,452
An earthlike planet within this region

1187
01:17:34,476 --> 01:17:37,291
simply wouldn't be able to maintain a stable orbit.

1188
01:17:37,316 --> 01:17:40,342
But if such a planet were to be located further inwards,

1189
01:17:40,366 --> 01:17:42,510
things look a lot more optimistic.

1190
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,341
The fourth target was Gliese 547 A.

1191
01:17:46,366 --> 01:17:49,994
Once again, it's a sunlike star that forms a wide binary system

1192
01:17:50,019 --> 01:17:52,316
with a small brown dwarf companion.

1193
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:55,188
Apart from that, no planets as of yet.

1194
01:17:55,922 --> 01:18:00,092
Target number five was yet another sunlike star known as Gliese 327

1195
01:18:00,116 --> 01:18:01,925
with no confirmed planets.

1196
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:04,714
It does, however, show signs of being surrounded by either one

1197
01:18:04,739 --> 01:18:06,747
or multiple belts of debris.

1198
01:18:06,772 --> 01:18:11,411
But the precise mass, composition, and extent of this debris remains to be seen.

1199
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:15,396
Finally, the sixth target was Gliese 788.

1200
01:18:15,421 --> 01:18:20,230
It is yet another solar analog with neither stellar nor planetary companions.

1201
01:18:21,004 --> 01:18:24,265
All but one of the targets are more than 50 lightyears away, so

1202
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:27,084
the minimum response time is over a century.

1203
01:18:27,109 --> 01:18:31,418
The one exception is 47 Ursae Majoris at 45 lightyears,

1204
01:18:31,442 --> 01:18:36,497
so we could hear back from the Majorans as early as 2092.

1205
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,525
As the name Encounter 2001 would seem to imply,

1206
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:53,442
the Millennial Voyage was scheduled to launch by the end of 2001.

1207
01:18:53,467 --> 01:18:55,312
But shortly before the start of that year,

1208
01:18:55,337 --> 01:18:59,076
the project was quietly rebranded as Team Encounter.

1209
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:02,456
While it's difficult to know exactly what was going on behind the scenes,

1210
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,437
it seems like they vastly overestimated the public's interest

1211
01:19:05,462 --> 01:19:07,656
in sending messages into space.

1212
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,815
As mentioned before, the team expected to attract

1213
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,725
somewhere between 1.5 and 4.5 million customers.

1214
01:19:14,266 --> 01:19:17,568
A few months after launch, they had sold 45...

1215
01:19:18,049 --> 01:19:19,059
...tickets.

1216
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:22,526
While sales ramped up quite a bit before the first Cosmic Call,

1217
01:19:22,551 --> 01:19:27,656
43 000 customers was still a far cry from the millions they had anticipated.

1218
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,555
With such lackluster performance,

1219
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:32,136
the company had no choice but to push back the launch date

1220
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:37,126
of the Millennial Voyage by several years and changed the name to Team Encounter.

1221
01:19:37,151 --> 01:19:40,967
But even after significant delays, a few celebrity endorsements,

1222
01:19:40,992 --> 01:19:43,580
and numerous attempts to get people interested,

1223
01:19:43,605 --> 01:19:47,534
sales lagged behind expectations by a wide margin.

1224
01:19:47,559 --> 01:19:51,737
By the summer of 2003, the company's main investor finally pulled the plug,

1225
01:19:51,762 --> 01:19:54,097
and the project was summarily abandoned.

1226
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:56,376
While this meant the Millennial Voyage was dead,

1227
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,922
Team Encounter did at the very least uphold their promise

1228
01:19:58,947 --> 01:20:01,308
of transmitting a second Cosmic Call.

1229
01:20:01,332 --> 01:20:04,738
The composition of which was very similar to the first.

1230
01:20:04,763 --> 01:20:06,853
Just like before, it started with a primer

1231
01:20:06,877 --> 01:20:09,430
designed by Yvan Dutil and Stéphane Dumas.

1232
01:20:09,455 --> 01:20:11,629
However, they actually created a new set of glyphs,

1233
01:20:11,654 --> 01:20:14,216
even more noise-resistant than the first.

1234
01:20:14,241 --> 01:20:18,882
The 23 bitmaps were also redesigned and combined into one large image,

1235
01:20:18,907 --> 01:20:22,136
but the contents of the primer stayed more or less the same.

1236
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:25,092
This was followed by a copy of the Arecibo Message,

1237
01:20:25,117 --> 01:20:27,354
a few images from the Teenage Message,

1238
01:20:27,379 --> 01:20:29,933
a description of the now canceled Millennial Voyage,

1239
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:32,696
and greetings by the staff at Team Encounter.

1240
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,472
Last but not least was the commercial payload.

1241
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:39,830
This included not just the names and greetings of more than 100 000 customers,

1242
01:20:39,855 --> 01:20:44,433
but also more unique contributions like a chatbot program called Ella,

1243
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:46,750
the contents of an entire website,

1244
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:49,863
and the song Starman by David Bowie.

1245
01:20:50,922 --> 01:20:53,416
All of which was, of course, converted into binary

1246
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,965
before being transmitted into space

1247
01:20:54,989 --> 01:20:59,360
from the Evpatoria Deep Space Center on July 6, 2003.

1248
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:01,830
[Hugh Downs] The people of the planet Earth

1249
01:21:01,855 --> 01:21:07,730
send their greetings and friendship to you, across lightyears of interstellar space.

1250
01:21:07,755 --> 01:21:12,339
The message we send to you today contains information about our Solar System,

1251
01:21:12,364 --> 01:21:14,725
our planet, and ourselves.

1252
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:20,888
We invite you to contact us and to share your knowledge, culture, and wisdom.

1253
01:21:20,913 --> 01:21:25,746
May this Cosmic Call open an exciting dialogue between our two stars

1254
01:21:25,771 --> 01:21:27,972
here in the Milky Way galaxy.

1255
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:36,140
Much like the first Cosmic Call, the second was beamed toward multiple targets.

1256
01:21:36,165 --> 01:21:40,055
There were five in total, and the first one was Gliese 67.

1257
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:43,091
It's a binary system composed of a sunlike primary

1258
01:21:43,115 --> 01:21:47,147
and a red dwarf companion that takes about 20 years to complete an orbit.

1259
01:21:47,172 --> 01:21:49,587
While neither one is known to harbor any planets,

1260
01:21:49,612 --> 01:21:51,495
and the distance between them is less than that

1261
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,410
between the Sun and Jupiter at closest approach,

1262
01:21:54,435 --> 01:21:56,800
they're still far enough apart for an earthlike planet

1263
01:21:56,824 --> 01:22:01,031
within their respective habitable zones to maintain a stable orbit.

1264
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:05,047
The second target was Gliese 208 A,

1265
01:22:05,072 --> 01:22:07,805
which is only about half the size and mass of the Sun

1266
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:11,947
and forms a wide binary system with an even smaller companion.

1267
01:22:11,972 --> 01:22:15,590
No planets as of yet, and it could be as young as half a billion years,

1268
01:22:15,615 --> 01:22:19,079
which would make it unlikely to host a spacefaring civilization.

1269
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,830
Target number three was 55 Cancri A,

1270
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:25,632
a star that's a bit fainter and colder than the Sun,

1271
01:22:25,657 --> 01:22:27,838
with a distant red dwarf companion.

1272
01:22:27,862 --> 01:22:30,136
It's the host of five confirmed planets,

1273
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:34,536
with the fourth one, dubbed Harriot, orbiting within the habitable zone.

1274
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,216
Now, because Harriot's mass is at least three times that of Neptune,

1275
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:41,460
it's not a very likely candidate for life as we know it.

1276
01:22:41,485 --> 01:22:45,488
But it's not inconceivable for life to have emerged on an earthlike moon

1277
01:22:45,513 --> 01:22:47,945
in orbit around Harriot.

1278
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:52,269
Not only that, but it is possible for an earthlike planet to maintain a stable orbit

1279
01:22:52,281 --> 01:22:54,696
within the outer half of the habitable zone,

1280
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:58,571
although simulations suggest that such a planet is far more likely to have formed

1281
01:22:58,596 --> 01:22:59,982
just outside of it.

1282
01:23:00,522 --> 01:23:03,433
The fourth target was 47 Ursae Majoris,

1283
01:23:03,457 --> 01:23:06,187
which was previously the target of the Teenage Message,

1284
01:23:06,212 --> 01:23:10,776
making this the first time we've signaled the same star more than once.

1285
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,595
Finally, the fifth target was Gliese 49,

1286
01:23:13,619 --> 01:23:16,235
which has a lot in common with the second target.

1287
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:19,490
It's a red dwarf about half the size and mass of the Sun

1288
01:23:19,515 --> 01:23:22,737
that probably forms an extremely wide binary system

1289
01:23:22,761 --> 01:23:24,629
with an even smaller companion.

1290
01:23:24,654 --> 01:23:27,357
While a planet with a mass of more than five times that of Earth

1291
01:23:27,382 --> 01:23:29,336
has been detected around the primary,

1292
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,992
it's unlikely to be habitable due to its proximity to the star.

1293
01:23:33,017 --> 01:23:36,113
But even if that wasn't the case, the system is probably too young

1294
01:23:36,137 --> 01:23:39,411
to host a communicative civilization in the first place.

1295
01:23:40,387 --> 01:23:44,533
Nevertheless, Gliese 49 is the least distant of the five targets

1296
01:23:44,558 --> 01:23:45,931
at 32 lightyears,

1297
01:23:45,956 --> 01:23:50,905
meaning any potential replies could reach us no sooner than 2067.

1298
01:23:55,003 --> 01:23:57,668
Now, two years after the second Cosmic Call

1299
01:23:57,701 --> 01:24:00,482
in the small European Republic of San Marino,

1300
01:24:00,507 --> 01:24:04,513
Hungarian astronomer Iván Almár proposed a ten-point scale

1301
01:24:04,538 --> 01:24:07,736
for quantifying the risk of interstellar messages.

1302
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,356
According to this scale, a transmission like the Arecibo Message

1303
01:24:11,381 --> 01:24:16,895
carries a risk of 8, which is characterized as a far-reaching threat to humanity.

1304
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,031
Meanwhile, the two Cosmic Calls and the Teenage Message

1305
01:24:20,056 --> 01:24:24,647
supposedly carry a risk of 7, giving them a threat level of high.

1306
01:24:25,347 --> 01:24:28,807
While the risk factor is partially determined by objective metrics

1307
01:24:28,832 --> 01:24:30,948
like signal strength and duration,

1308
01:24:30,972 --> 01:24:33,816
it's also based on the contents of a message.

1309
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,829
This makes the San Marino Scale inherently subjective,

1310
01:24:36,854 --> 01:24:40,559
and it also fails to consider other crucial factors like the distance to

1311
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:43,373
and habitability of the target.

1312
01:24:43,398 --> 01:24:45,963
That being said, the creation of the San Marino Scale

1313
01:24:45,987 --> 01:24:48,050
is a fascinating development because

1314
01:24:48,075 --> 01:24:51,953
it highlights just how contentious the transmission debate had become.

1315
01:24:51,978 --> 01:24:55,050
Many prominent figures within the SETI community,

1316
01:24:55,075 --> 01:24:57,848
that being the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

1317
01:24:57,873 --> 01:25:00,967
had become a lot more hesitant or outright opposed

1318
01:25:00,992 --> 01:25:03,134
to what had come to be known as METI,

1319
01:25:03,159 --> 01:25:05,880
Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

1320
01:25:05,905 --> 01:25:08,883
A term coined by none other than Alexander Zaitsev

1321
01:25:08,907 --> 01:25:11,378
during the creation of the Teenage Message.

1322
01:25:12,032 --> 01:25:14,928
Pushing back against this growing opposition to METI,

1323
01:25:14,953 --> 01:25:16,110
Zaitsev reasoned that

1324
01:25:16,135 --> 01:25:19,190
"in a galaxy where everyone is listening and no one is speaking...

1325
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:21,143
...someone has to make the first move."

1326
01:25:21,168 --> 01:25:27,866
He called attention to a poll showing that 78% of more than 140 000 SETI enthusiasts

1327
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:30,665
were, in fact, in support of METI.

1328
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:34,822
What he doesn't mention is that over half of those same respondents

1329
01:25:34,847 --> 01:25:38,468
were still unsure if the aliens they were hoping to contact

1330
01:25:38,493 --> 01:25:41,814
were more likely to be friendly or hostile.

1331
01:25:50,696 --> 01:25:51,979
Throughout the 1990s,

1332
01:25:52,003 --> 01:25:55,604
there was increasing demand within NASA to launch a mission to Pluto.

1333
01:25:55,629 --> 01:25:59,364
At the time, it was the last unexplored planet of the Solar System,

1334
01:25:59,389 --> 01:26:04,065
and even our most powerful telescopes could resolve nothing but a nebulous disc.

1335
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:07,495
After numerous failed attempts to secure the necessary funding,

1336
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:13,434
the spacecraft New Horizons was successfully launched on January 19, 2006.

1337
01:26:14,154 --> 01:26:15,107
[Announcer] Five.

1338
01:26:15,132 --> 01:26:16,113
[Announcer] Four.

1339
01:26:16,138 --> 01:26:17,100
[Announcer] Three.

1340
01:26:17,125 --> 01:26:18,080
[Announcer] Two

1341
01:26:18,105 --> 01:26:19,092
[Announcer] One.

1342
01:26:19,753 --> 01:26:24,252
We have ignition and liftoff of NASA's New Horizons spacecraft

1343
01:26:24,276 --> 01:26:29,224
on a decade long voyage to visit the planet Pluto and then beyond.

1344
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,576
After borrowing some extra speed from the almighty Jupiter,

1345
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,769
New Horizons finally caught up with Pluto in 2015.

1346
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,151
At the time of the launch, Pluto was still recognized as a planet.

1347
01:27:27,176 --> 01:27:29,015
But only seven months into the mission,

1348
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:32,616
it was reclassified by the International Astronomical Union

1349
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:34,141
as a dwarf planet.

1350
01:27:34,165 --> 01:27:37,675
A decision that remains somewhat controversial to this day.

1351
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:40,999
Although, strictly semantically speaking,

1352
01:27:41,024 --> 01:27:43,796
a dwarf planet is still a planet.

1353
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:45,682
It's right there in the name.

1354
01:27:46,061 --> 01:27:48,536
Anyway, much like the Pioneer and Voyager probes,

1355
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:53,070
New Horizons continued on into deep space, destined to leave the Solar System

1356
01:27:53,095 --> 01:27:54,617
and roam the galaxy.

1357
01:27:54,641 --> 01:27:56,600
Yet unlike its predecessors,

1358
01:27:56,624 --> 01:27:59,359
it does not carry a message.

1359
01:27:59,384 --> 01:28:01,345
According to lead scientist Alan Stern,

1360
01:28:01,369 --> 01:28:04,790
the inclusion of a plaque was brought up during the planning stages.

1361
01:28:04,815 --> 01:28:06,946
But he ultimately rejected that proposal

1362
01:28:06,971 --> 01:28:09,385
out of concern it might spark some sort of controversy

1363
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:11,685
that could take focus away from the mission.

1364
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:14,072
Not unlike what happened back in the '70s, when

1365
01:28:14,097 --> 01:28:17,781
actual adult human beings realized that underneath our clothes

1366
01:28:17,806 --> 01:28:19,841
is not more clothes.

1367
01:28:19,866 --> 01:28:22,176
Given that New Horizons was but the latest

1368
01:28:22,201 --> 01:28:25,649
in a long series of failed attempts to launch a mission to Pluto,

1369
01:28:25,674 --> 01:28:28,995
Stern did not want to risk yet another delay or worse.

1370
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:32,696
But as stern as Stern might have been regarding a deliberate message,

1371
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:37,496
he was not opposed to the inclusion of nine symbolic items described as mementos,

1372
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,216
placed within the nooks and crannies of the spacecraft.

1373
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:43,332
The most significant of which was this aluminum canister

1374
01:28:43,357 --> 01:28:45,416
containing the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh,

1375
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:49,345
the American astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930.

1376
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:51,576
Shortly before his passing in 1997,

1377
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,936
Tombaugh requested that his cremains be launched into space,

1378
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,493
and what better way to honor that request

1379
01:28:57,518 --> 01:29:00,502
than to sail him past the planet that he discovered.

1380
01:29:01,428 --> 01:29:05,192
The other eight mementos included two flags of the United States;

1381
01:29:07,112 --> 01:29:10,518
two state quarters, one from Maryland and one from Florida,

1382
01:29:10,543 --> 01:29:13,767
honoring the states in which the probe was built and launched;

1383
01:29:14,393 --> 01:29:15,876
a chunk of SpaceShipOne,

1384
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:20,087
paying tribute to the first successful crewed spaceflight by a private company;

1385
01:29:20,627 --> 01:29:25,290
a postage stamp describing Pluto as the only planet "NOT YET EXPLORED";

1386
01:29:25,797 --> 01:29:28,271
an off-the-shelf CD on the port side,

1387
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:30,893
loaded with the names of more than 400 000 people

1388
01:29:30,918 --> 01:29:33,072
who signed up during an online campaign;

1389
01:29:33,097 --> 01:29:35,172
and another CD on the starboard side,

1390
01:29:35,197 --> 01:29:36,708
loaded with notes and photographs

1391
01:29:36,732 --> 01:29:41,356
of people responsible for designing, building, and launching New Horizons.

1392
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:43,944
According to Stern, these artifacts were

1393
01:29:43,976 --> 01:29:46,457
"more efforts of the heart than the head"

1394
01:29:46,482 --> 01:29:48,293
and were intended for us here on Earth,

1395
01:29:48,317 --> 01:29:51,697
not whomever might stumble upon the probe in the distant future.

1396
01:29:51,722 --> 01:29:54,352
In fact, commercial CDs degrade over time

1397
01:29:54,377 --> 01:29:58,485
and become unreadable within decades or a few centuries at most.

1398
01:29:58,510 --> 01:30:01,480
Although, those estimates assume an earthlike environment,

1399
01:30:01,505 --> 01:30:04,221
not a spacecraft floating through the vacuum of space

1400
01:30:04,246 --> 01:30:07,513
while being shielded from a lot of otherwise damaging ultraviolet radiation

1401
01:30:07,537 --> 01:30:09,028
by a thermal blanket.

1402
01:30:09,053 --> 01:30:12,367
Somehow, longevity estimates for a CD being stored in those conditions

1403
01:30:12,392 --> 01:30:14,296
never came up in the search results.

1404
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,598
Anyway, the lack of a deliberate physical message

1405
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:19,336
bothered some people enough that in 2013,

1406
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,384
one of the makers of the Golden Records, Jon Lomberg,

1407
01:30:22,408 --> 01:30:25,144
launched a campaign to create a digital one.

1408
01:30:25,169 --> 01:30:27,376
The idea was for people around the world to submit

1409
01:30:27,401 --> 01:30:29,504
sounds, images, and other material

1410
01:30:29,528 --> 01:30:32,856
that could be uploaded to one of the memory banks aboard the spacecraft.

1411
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,364
While there was a lot of public support for the project

1412
01:30:35,389 --> 01:30:37,576
and Alan Stern was open to the idea,

1413
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,396
the One Earth message never materialized.

1414
01:30:40,408 --> 01:30:43,416
After a failed Kickstarter campaign in 2017,

1415
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,892
Lomberg stated in 2020 that NASA had initially said, "Yes",

1416
01:30:46,917 --> 01:30:49,016
but later changed their minds.

1417
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,713
Even if the project had succeeded,

1418
01:30:50,738 --> 01:30:54,163
the One Earth message would've been no less symbolic than the nine mementos

1419
01:30:54,188 --> 01:30:58,865
because, just like a compact disc, computer memory degrades over time.

1420
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:01,238
Even in the most optimistic of circumstances,

1421
01:31:01,262 --> 01:31:05,470
we're talking centuries, possibly a few millennia at best.

1422
01:31:05,495 --> 01:31:08,334
While it is a bit disappointing that no deliberate

1423
01:31:08,359 --> 01:31:11,355
lasting message was included with New Horizons,

1424
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:14,610
let's not forget that the probe itself is a message.

1425
01:31:14,634 --> 01:31:18,429
One that would provide any recipients with immediate confirmation

1426
01:31:18,453 --> 01:31:19,881
that they're not alone.

1427
01:31:19,906 --> 01:31:23,336
Although, that's presuming, of course, the probe is ever found.

1428
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,541
As I'm recording this,

1429
01:31:24,566 --> 01:31:28,216
New Horizons has not been directed towards any particular star system,

1430
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,192
but that could change in the future.

1431
01:31:30,216 --> 01:31:33,000
Following its encounter with Pluto in 2015

1432
01:31:33,025 --> 01:31:35,874
and this malformed space-potato in 2019,

1433
01:31:35,899 --> 01:31:37,808
the probe is now gliding through empty space

1434
01:31:37,832 --> 01:31:41,230
while astronomers keep searching for additional flyby targets.

1435
01:31:41,255 --> 01:31:42,964
So far, none have been detected,

1436
01:31:42,988 --> 01:31:46,597
but the probe has enough juice to keep going until at least the 2040s.

1437
01:31:46,622 --> 01:31:50,456
So a few decades from now, shortly before it runs out of power,

1438
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,867
NASA could choose to steer the probe towards a star system

1439
01:31:53,892 --> 01:31:56,161
in its general direction of travel.

1440
01:31:57,091 --> 01:32:01,674
While such a course-corrected voyage would still take untold eons, and

1441
01:32:01,699 --> 01:32:04,551
humanity could be long gone by the time it arrives,

1442
01:32:04,575 --> 01:32:08,850
I think it would be quite exciting to know that one of our foremost ambassadors

1443
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:12,369
was headed for something rather than nothing.

1444
01:32:24,795 --> 01:32:27,467
In early 2008, a man named Martin Lewis

1445
01:32:27,499 --> 01:32:31,523
approached NASA with the idea of beaming The Beatles song Across the Universe

1446
01:32:31,547 --> 01:32:33,021
across the universe.

1447
01:32:33,046 --> 01:32:34,873
As a Beatles historian,

1448
01:32:34,897 --> 01:32:38,380
Lewis sought to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the song's recording,

1449
01:32:38,405 --> 01:32:41,340
and NASA seems to have agreed because the year also happened to mark

1450
01:32:41,365 --> 01:32:44,536
the 50th anniversary of the agency's founding.

1451
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,849
Using a massive antenna at the Deep Space Communications Complex

1452
01:32:47,874 --> 01:32:50,440
located west of Madrid in the middle of Spain,

1453
01:32:50,464 --> 01:32:54,751
the nearly 4-minute song was beamed towards Polaris, the famous North Star,

1454
01:32:54,776 --> 01:32:57,102
on February 4, 2008.

1455
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:01,495
Former Beatles member Paul McCartney approved of the message by saying...

1456
01:33:03,128 --> 01:33:06,800
But it's highly unlikely for Polaris to be inhabited.

1457
01:33:06,825 --> 01:33:11,279
For one thing, it's not a solitary star but a system of three.

1458
01:33:11,304 --> 01:33:15,736
The primary is a supergiant that's about two and a half thousand times brighter

1459
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,736
and nearly fifty times larger than the Sun.

1460
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,536
Placed at the center of the Solar System,

1461
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,643
its radius would extend about halfway to Mercury.

1462
01:33:23,667 --> 01:33:27,254
Meanwhile, its closest companion is a bit more massive than the Sun

1463
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:30,162
and takes nearly 30 years to complete an orbit.

1464
01:33:30,187 --> 01:33:33,658
This tight-knit binary system is then encircled by a third star

1465
01:33:33,683 --> 01:33:36,364
that's many tens of Pluto orbits away.

1466
01:33:36,984 --> 01:33:39,153
No planets have been discovered as of yet, but

1467
01:33:39,165 --> 01:33:41,416
even if an earthlike planet with a stable orbit

1468
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:44,196
could be found within one of the stars' habitable zones,

1469
01:33:44,221 --> 01:33:46,634
Polaris probably hasn't existed long enough

1470
01:33:46,659 --> 01:33:48,943
for intelligent life to have emerged.

1471
01:33:48,967 --> 01:33:52,013
While the two companions could be as old as two billion years,

1472
01:33:52,038 --> 01:33:56,216
it seems like the primary has only been around for a few tens of millions.

1473
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:57,915
As if that was not bad enough,

1474
01:33:57,940 --> 01:34:01,596
Across the Universe won't arrive until the middle of the 25th century

1475
01:34:01,621 --> 01:34:05,360
because Polaris is more than 400 lightyears away.

1476
01:34:15,008 --> 01:34:16,636
In the spring of 2008,

1477
01:34:16,661 --> 01:34:20,008
the brand Doritos launched a campaign in the United Kingdom called

1478
01:34:20,033 --> 01:34:21,725
You Make It, We Play It.

1479
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:25,656
The idea was for members of the public to create a short commercial about Doritos,

1480
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:28,810
and the winning entry would not only be played on national television,

1481
01:34:28,835 --> 01:34:30,776
but also beamed into space.

1482
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,136
From a radar station in the middle of Svalbard in the Arctic Circle,

1483
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:39,765
a six-hour loop of the 30-second advert departed Earth on June 12, 2008.

1484
01:34:54,944 --> 01:34:58,074
The target was, once again, 47 Ursae Majoris,

1485
01:34:58,099 --> 01:35:02,310
meaning we've now dispatched three separate messages to this singular star.

1486
01:35:02,335 --> 01:35:03,934
Presuming the Majorans are listening,

1487
01:35:03,958 --> 01:35:07,276
they'll be hearing the Teenage Message in late 2046,

1488
01:35:07,288 --> 01:35:10,296
the second Cosmic Call in late 2048,

1489
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:14,154
and an unprompted admission that we like to hasten our mortal doom

1490
01:35:14,179 --> 01:35:16,969
by voluntarily consuming dusty triangles of death

1491
01:35:16,994 --> 01:35:18,853
sometime in late 2053.

1492
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:20,590
Response time?

1493
01:35:20,615 --> 01:35:21,676
Let's hope not.

1494
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:31,711
In the summer of 2008,

1495
01:35:31,735 --> 01:35:34,729
a now-defunct social media platform named Bebo

1496
01:35:34,754 --> 01:35:37,595
launched a project known as A Message From Earth.

1497
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:41,236
It primarily functioned as a publicity stunt to advertise the website,

1498
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:44,628
and like so many initiatives before it, crowdsourced the creation of a message

1499
01:35:44,653 --> 01:35:47,896
by inviting its users to submit text and images.

1500
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,312
Some untold number of submissions, and several months later,

1501
01:35:51,337 --> 01:35:54,847
the 501 most upvoted entries were beamed into space

1502
01:35:54,872 --> 01:35:58,936
from the Evpatoria Deep Space Center on October 9, 2008.

1503
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:26,446
Considering that this was open to the internet,

1504
01:36:26,471 --> 01:36:30,890
I strongly suspect many messages were a lot less sanitized than what we just heard.

1505
01:36:30,915 --> 01:36:35,779
But since participation required you to be logged in and Bebo went offline in 2013,

1506
01:36:35,804 --> 01:36:39,016
very little of A Message From Earth has been preserved.

1507
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:43,098
Nevertheless, the target was a red dwarf known as Gliese 581

1508
01:36:43,123 --> 01:36:47,234
that's a lot smaller, lighter, fainter, and colder than the Sun.

1509
01:36:47,259 --> 01:36:50,409
What this means is that an earthlike planet within this system

1510
01:36:50,433 --> 01:36:52,573
has to orbit very close to its star

1511
01:36:52,598 --> 01:36:55,468
to receive the same amount of energy as the Earth.

1512
01:36:55,493 --> 01:37:00,200
So close, in fact, that the outer edge of the habitable zone around Gliese 581

1513
01:37:00,224 --> 01:37:04,414
is closer than Mercury is to the Sun by a wide margin.

1514
01:37:04,439 --> 01:37:08,587
With planets orbiting so close, it makes them vulnerable to flaring events,

1515
01:37:08,612 --> 01:37:13,560
and it just so happens that red dwarfs have a penchant for sudden bursts of radiation.

1516
01:37:13,585 --> 01:37:17,816
Not only can these eruptions have a sterilizing effect on nearby planets,

1517
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,015
but if there's one thing that life on Earth does not appreciate,

1518
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:24,372
it's sudden and dramatic changes to the climate.

1519
01:37:24,397 --> 01:37:26,776
Not that we would know anything about that, now, would we?

1520
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,749
The good news is that Gliese 581

1521
01:37:28,774 --> 01:37:31,976
has a better chance than most of hosting an earthlike planet

1522
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,642
because it's very old, and therefore a lot less active

1523
01:37:34,667 --> 01:37:36,593
than many of its younger siblings.

1524
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:39,499
It's also quite close at less than 21 lightyears,

1525
01:37:39,524 --> 01:37:43,366
meaning a reply could arrive as early as 2049.

1526
01:37:43,391 --> 01:37:45,646
Even more promising is that shortly before

1527
01:37:45,671 --> 01:37:48,216
and after A Message From Earth was transmitted,

1528
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:51,326
astronomers discovered not just one, but two planets

1529
01:37:51,351 --> 01:37:53,286
a few times more massive than Earth

1530
01:37:53,311 --> 01:37:55,625
orbiting within the star's habitable zone.

1531
01:37:56,450 --> 01:38:00,671
Unfortunately, follow-up studies failed to corroborate those findings,

1532
01:38:00,696 --> 01:38:05,540
suggesting the initially planet-looking signals were nothing more than noise.

1533
01:38:06,194 --> 01:38:08,899
Unless additional planets can be found in the future,

1534
01:38:08,924 --> 01:38:10,393
any remaining hope of life

1535
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:13,718
falls to the three confirmed planets that lie a bit further inward.

1536
01:38:13,743 --> 01:38:16,982
However, due to their even greater proximity to the star with

1537
01:38:17,007 --> 01:38:19,411
orbital periods of only a few days,

1538
01:38:19,435 --> 01:38:23,335
chances are they're less earthlike and more mercurylike.

1539
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,479
To commemorate the 400th anniversary

1540
01:38:33,504 --> 01:38:39,031
of astronomical contributions made by Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler in 1609,

1541
01:38:39,056 --> 01:38:42,251
the United Nations along with the International Astronomical Union

1542
01:38:42,276 --> 01:38:46,296
declared 2009 the International Year of Astronomy.

1543
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,856
Unsure of how best to celebrate this milestone,

1544
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:51,238
a representative of the Australian government

1545
01:38:51,262 --> 01:38:55,176
reached out to a popular science magazine known as Cosmos.

1546
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:57,962
The magazine's editor-in-chief, Wilson da Silva,

1547
01:38:57,987 --> 01:39:00,074
suggested they transmit an interstellar message

1548
01:39:00,098 --> 01:39:03,945
during an upcoming annual event known as National Science Week.

1549
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:06,197
They were soon given the green light by the government,

1550
01:39:06,209 --> 01:39:09,320
and after consulting a bunch of astronomers, NASA, and others,

1551
01:39:09,345 --> 01:39:12,491
Cosmos launched a website called Hello From Earth.

1552
01:39:12,516 --> 01:39:15,983
The project was described by da Silva as "Twitter to the Stars"

1553
01:39:16,008 --> 01:39:19,062
because the idea was to allow anyone to submit a brief text message

1554
01:39:19,087 --> 01:39:21,976
of no more than 160 characters in length.

1555
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,336
When the submission period came to a close less than two weeks later,

1556
01:39:25,361 --> 01:39:28,665
the website had received nearly 26 000 messages.

1557
01:39:29,032 --> 01:39:31,617
According to da Silva, less than 1% of the comments

1558
01:39:31,655 --> 01:39:36,145
contained some sort of rule-breaking content like profanity, slurs, and so on.

1559
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:37,586
They were also forced by NASA

1560
01:39:37,611 --> 01:39:40,719
to remove anything deemed even remotely sexual or aggressive,

1561
01:39:40,744 --> 01:39:44,296
like the word "breast" and the phrase "all your base are belong to us",

1562
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:47,807
which is just a line from an old video game that later became a meme.

1563
01:39:47,832 --> 01:39:51,496
As someone who's old enough to have been around back when this meme was still popular,

1564
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,442
this might be one of the most depressing things I've ever had to explain in a video.

1565
01:39:56,022 --> 01:40:00,180
Painful reminders that we're all stuck on a travelator towards eternal nothingness aside,

1566
01:40:00,205 --> 01:40:02,517
once all the messages had been vetted and approved,

1567
01:40:02,529 --> 01:40:04,325
they were transmitted from a large antenna

1568
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:06,653
at the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex

1569
01:40:06,678 --> 01:40:10,666
in the Australian southeast on August 28, 2009.

1570
01:41:32,068 --> 01:41:34,947
Much like A Message From Earth, Hello From Earth

1571
01:41:34,972 --> 01:41:39,259
was also directed towards the nearby red dwarf Gliese 581.

1572
01:41:39,284 --> 01:41:42,005
As mentioned before, observations conducted back then

1573
01:41:42,029 --> 01:41:45,608
suggested the presence of two planets within the star's habitable zone,

1574
01:41:45,633 --> 01:41:48,376
but those findings have since been refuted.

1575
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:52,704
Nevertheless, Gliese 581 is now the second star to be signaled more than once

1576
01:41:52,729 --> 01:41:55,155
after 47 Ursae Majoris.

1577
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:57,627
While the International Year of Astronomy

1578
01:41:57,652 --> 01:42:00,497
was primarily dedicated to Galileo and Kepler,

1579
01:42:00,522 --> 01:42:05,230
2009 also marked the 35th anniversary of the Arecibo Message.

1580
01:42:05,255 --> 01:42:10,812
Something that American artist Joe Davis decided to celebrate in his own unique way.

1581
01:42:18,923 --> 01:42:23,362
One of the most vital biological mechanisms on Earth is photosynthesis,

1582
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:26,167
the ability of some organisms like plants and algae

1583
01:42:26,191 --> 01:42:31,321
to produce life-essential oxygen using water, sunlight, and carbon dioxide.

1584
01:42:31,346 --> 01:42:36,789
Now, a crucial component of photosynthesis is a special molecule known as RuBisCO.

1585
01:42:36,814 --> 01:42:40,727
RuBisCO is what's known as a protein, or more specifically an enzyme,

1586
01:42:40,752 --> 01:42:43,258
that's been around for billions of years.

1587
01:42:43,283 --> 01:42:47,882
Presuming the evolution of life here on Earth is typical rather than special,

1588
01:42:47,907 --> 01:42:50,638
one possible way to communicate with an alien species

1589
01:42:50,663 --> 01:42:53,766
would be to send them very basic biological information.

1590
01:42:53,791 --> 01:42:57,176
If their path to intelligence bears any resemblance to our own,

1591
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:59,206
there's a chance they'll recognize an enzyme

1592
01:42:59,231 --> 01:43:02,218
as ancient and rudimentary as RuBisCO.

1593
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:06,108
This was the idea that occurred to Joe Davis in late 2009.

1594
01:43:06,133 --> 01:43:09,517
But instead of using something more conventional like binary code,

1595
01:43:09,542 --> 01:43:14,362
he decided to map the RuBisCO gene sequence to four increasingly syllabic phrases

1596
01:43:14,387 --> 01:43:17,093
alluding to an ancient Greek proverb.

1597
01:43:17,118 --> 01:43:20,776
These were then vocalized and turned into a 15-minute audio sample

1598
01:43:20,801 --> 01:43:24,056
using the text-to-speech feature on a regular iPhone.

1599
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:27,171
Now, if you feel like you couldn't quite follow all of that, no need to worry.

1600
01:43:27,196 --> 01:43:29,637
There's zero chance the aliens will either.

1601
01:43:29,662 --> 01:43:34,572
Much like Davis' previous project, the RuBisCO Stars Message was largely symbolic

1602
01:43:34,597 --> 01:43:38,216
and primarily intended to evoke a reaction from people here on Earth.

1603
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:40,576
Nevertheless, using his academic connections,

1604
01:43:40,601 --> 01:43:43,625
Davis managed to book time at the Arecibo Telescope.

1605
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:45,830
Then, on November 7, 2009,

1606
01:43:45,854 --> 01:43:49,731
just over a week before the 35th anniversary of the Arecibo Message,

1607
01:43:49,756 --> 01:43:53,101
a frequency-shifted audio recording of a synthetic voice

1608
01:43:53,126 --> 01:43:57,391
rattling off fragmentary sentences representing the RuBisCO gene sequence

1609
01:43:57,416 --> 01:44:00,033
was beamed towards three nearby stars.

1610
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:29,406
The first target was TZ Arietis, a red dwarf less than 15 lightyears away

1611
01:44:29,431 --> 01:44:32,693
with one confirmed planet approaching the mass of Saturn.

1612
01:44:32,718 --> 01:44:35,124
It's a very active flare star so

1613
01:44:35,149 --> 01:44:40,216
even if an earthlike planet could be found, it's unlikely to host life as we know it.

1614
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:43,285
Meanwhile, the third target was Kappa¹ Ceti,

1615
01:44:43,309 --> 01:44:46,466
a sunlike star barely 30 lightyears from Earth.

1616
01:44:46,491 --> 01:44:49,734
While it is similar to the Sun, it's also a lot younger,

1617
01:44:49,759 --> 01:44:52,082
making it unlikely that sufficient time has elapsed

1618
01:44:52,107 --> 01:44:54,931
for a communicative civilization to have emerged.

1619
01:44:55,791 --> 01:44:58,786
But the second target is a lot more interesting.

1620
01:44:58,798 --> 01:45:01,882
It's another red dwarf known as Teegarden's Star,

1621
01:45:01,907 --> 01:45:04,170
and while it does exhibit occasional flaring,

1622
01:45:04,195 --> 01:45:08,253
it's a lot older and much less active than most of its kind.

1623
01:45:08,278 --> 01:45:10,665
Furthermore, it's home to three confirmed planets

1624
01:45:10,690 --> 01:45:13,029
with masses very similar to that of Earth,

1625
01:45:13,053 --> 01:45:16,253
and two of them orbit within the habitable zone.

1626
01:45:16,278 --> 01:45:18,069
To quote a recent paper,

1627
01:45:18,093 --> 01:45:23,075
they are "among the most Earth-like exoplanets currently known."

1628
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:26,923
But earthlike does not necessarily mean habitable

1629
01:45:26,948 --> 01:45:31,765
because flares are but one obstacle that red dwarf planets have to overcome.

1630
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:35,061
Another potential hazard is something known as tidal locking.

1631
01:45:35,085 --> 01:45:36,635
Without going into too much detail,

1632
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:40,737
the simplest form of tidal locking is when the rotation of a celestial body

1633
01:45:40,762 --> 01:45:43,192
becomes synchronized with its orbital period.

1634
01:45:43,216 --> 01:45:45,802
The most famous example of this is the Moon.

1635
01:45:45,827 --> 01:45:49,820
It completes precisely one rotation for every orbit around the Earth,

1636
01:45:49,845 --> 01:45:53,016
which is why we only ever see one side of the Moon.

1637
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:57,311
The reason this happens is a bit complicated, but it's tied to proximity.

1638
01:45:57,336 --> 01:45:58,693
The tighter the orbit,

1639
01:45:58,717 --> 01:46:02,856
the more likely it is for a celestial body to become tidally locked to its host.

1640
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:07,149
As you can imagine, planets orbiting red dwarfs are especially susceptible,

1641
01:46:07,174 --> 01:46:09,904
as they have to orbit very close to their star

1642
01:46:09,929 --> 01:46:12,377
to retain liquid water on their surface.

1643
01:46:12,402 --> 01:46:15,082
Sure enough, the three planets orbiting Teegarden's Star

1644
01:46:15,106 --> 01:46:18,615
are all believed to be tidally locked, just like the Moon.

1645
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:20,257
This is less than ideal

1646
01:46:20,281 --> 01:46:23,896
because it means that one hemisphere is cooked by everlasting starlight

1647
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:26,632
while the other is plunged into eternal night.

1648
01:46:26,657 --> 01:46:29,113
Habitability estimates for such bisected worlds

1649
01:46:29,138 --> 01:46:33,205
range from extremely pessimistic to cautiously optimistic

1650
01:46:33,230 --> 01:46:35,017
because some climate models suggest

1651
01:46:35,042 --> 01:46:37,815
warm air from the dayside creeps into the nightside,

1652
01:46:37,839 --> 01:46:42,106
which pushes cold air from the nightside into the dayside, and so on.

1653
01:46:42,118 --> 01:46:46,088
The end result of which is a planet with a surprisingly temperate climate

1654
01:46:46,113 --> 01:46:50,925
that keeps water at perfect equilibrium between freezing and evaporating.

1655
01:46:50,950 --> 01:46:53,783
But even if we accept the more optimistic models,

1656
01:46:53,808 --> 01:46:55,565
the proximity of red dwarf planets

1657
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:59,611
also makes them less likely to retain an atmosphere in the first place.

1658
01:46:59,636 --> 01:47:04,045
That's because stars tend to shed vast quantities of material into space,

1659
01:47:04,070 --> 01:47:08,235
and the closer you get, the more intense that stellar wind becomes.

1660
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:09,965
As if that was not bad enough,

1661
01:47:09,990 --> 01:47:13,698
this wind is occasionally interrupted by more explosive events

1662
01:47:13,723 --> 01:47:19,256
like coronal mass ejections that can expel billions of tons of superheated plasma

1663
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:20,943
in a matter of minutes.

1664
01:47:20,967 --> 01:47:25,726
Here's one being ejected from the Sun with the Earth hauntingly to scale.

1665
01:47:35,745 --> 01:47:37,477
In the case of Teegarden's Star

1666
01:47:37,516 --> 01:47:41,775
the two innermost planets are between 9 and 15 times closer

1667
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:44,040
than Mercury is to the Sun.

1668
01:47:44,065 --> 01:47:48,623
It only takes them 11 and 5 days, respectively, to complete an orbit.

1669
01:47:49,302 --> 01:47:53,562
According to one recent study, that's close enough for the stellar winds alone

1670
01:47:53,587 --> 01:47:57,183
to completely strip those planets of a lasting atmosphere.

1671
01:47:58,056 --> 01:48:02,092
While atmospheric erosion could be mitigated by a strong magnetic field

1672
01:48:02,117 --> 01:48:04,056
like the one that surrounds the Earth,

1673
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,661
the magnetosphere of tidally locked planets

1674
01:48:06,686 --> 01:48:09,950
would likely be reduced by their sluggish rotation.

1675
01:48:09,975 --> 01:48:14,376
All that being said, the habitability of red dwarf planets remains open to debate.

1676
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,266
There is so much we don't know, and

1677
01:48:16,291 --> 01:48:19,366
theories, simulations, and mathematical models

1678
01:48:19,391 --> 01:48:21,798
can only do so much to fill in the blanks.

1679
01:48:21,823 --> 01:48:26,569
Red dwarfs account for approximately three quarters of all stars in the Milky Way,

1680
01:48:26,594 --> 01:48:31,592
so it would be a real shame if not a single one of them can support life as we know it.

1681
01:48:32,345 --> 01:48:37,205
It's possible that some environments are conducive to life while others are not.

1682
01:48:37,230 --> 01:48:40,776
The tricky part is determining where that line should be drawn.

1683
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,155
Presuming the planets orbiting Teegarden's Star

1684
01:48:43,167 --> 01:48:46,104
have, in fact, cradled beings of sufficient intelligence,

1685
01:48:46,129 --> 01:48:49,658
a reply to the RuBisCO Stars Message could be heading our way

1686
01:48:49,683 --> 01:48:51,232
right this very moment.

1687
01:48:51,712 --> 01:48:55,043
The signal would've reached the Teegardenese back in 2022,

1688
01:48:55,068 --> 01:48:58,939
which amounts to a roundtrip ETA of 2034.

1689
01:49:00,705 --> 01:49:02,215
Don't forget to mark your calendars.

1690
01:49:02,635 --> 01:49:04,599
No, genuinely this time.

1691
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:16,381
Late one evening on August 15, 1977,

1692
01:49:16,405 --> 01:49:21,566
the Big Ear Telescope in the US state of Ohio performed a routine survey of the sky.

1693
01:49:21,591 --> 01:49:24,718
A few days later, a volunteer named Jerry Ehman

1694
01:49:24,743 --> 01:49:27,153
sat down to review the collected data.

1695
01:49:27,178 --> 01:49:30,273
What he found was a signal so exceptionally strong

1696
01:49:30,298 --> 01:49:32,795
that he encircled the sequence on the printout sheet

1697
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:36,102
and famously wrote "Wow!" in the left-hand margin.

1698
01:49:36,709 --> 01:49:39,392
The Wow! Signal remains a mystery to this day.

1699
01:49:39,417 --> 01:49:42,176
Not least of all because it was never detected again

1700
01:49:42,201 --> 01:49:44,309
despite numerous attempts to do so.

1701
01:49:44,334 --> 01:49:48,397
The sequence 6-E-Q-U-J-5 is not some sort of code

1702
01:49:48,422 --> 01:49:51,169
but merely the intensity of the signal over time,

1703
01:49:51,194 --> 01:49:54,885
where numbers above 9 are represented by letters to save space.

1704
01:49:54,910 --> 01:49:58,267
It makes a lot more sense if we plot it onto a graph like this.

1705
01:49:58,292 --> 01:49:59,825
It begins with a value of 6,

1706
01:49:59,850 --> 01:50:03,139
meaning it was six times more intense than normal background noise.

1707
01:50:03,164 --> 01:50:06,538
The signal then jumped up to 14, followed by 26,

1708
01:50:06,562 --> 01:50:09,891
and a peak intensity of 30 times above background.

1709
01:50:09,916 --> 01:50:14,564
The signal then fell back down to 19 and then 5, before it disappeared.

1710
01:50:14,589 --> 01:50:17,953
Each of the six samples were recorded 12 seconds apart

1711
01:50:17,977 --> 01:50:20,946
and this 72-second rise and fall

1712
01:50:20,971 --> 01:50:24,496
is perfectly consistent with the telescope panning over the source

1713
01:50:24,521 --> 01:50:26,304
along with the Earth's rotation.

1714
01:50:26,328 --> 01:50:28,492
In other words, the source of the Wow! Signal

1715
01:50:28,517 --> 01:50:33,012
appears to have been more or less fixed in the night sky, much like a distant star.

1716
01:50:33,037 --> 01:50:36,142
Had it been an earthbound source it would have moved with the telescope

1717
01:50:36,167 --> 01:50:38,337
while things like airplanes and satellites

1718
01:50:38,361 --> 01:50:42,718
would likely have moved too fast to remain visible for the whole 72 seconds.

1719
01:50:42,743 --> 01:50:45,240
The Wow! Signal was also tantalizingly close

1720
01:50:45,265 --> 01:50:47,980
to the frequency of the aforementioned hydrogen line.

1721
01:50:48,005 --> 01:50:50,506
This makes it even less likely to be man-made because

1722
01:50:50,531 --> 01:50:55,018
it falls within a protected band of frequencies reserved for radio astronomy.

1723
01:50:55,043 --> 01:50:57,577
On top of that, it had a very narrow bandwidth.

1724
01:50:57,602 --> 01:51:00,091
What this means is that, unlike a star, for instance,

1725
01:51:00,116 --> 01:51:03,637
which emits radiation across a wide spectrum of frequencies,

1726
01:51:03,662 --> 01:51:06,034
the Wow! Signal was very focused.

1727
01:51:06,059 --> 01:51:10,795
It's by no means impossible for a natural source to produce such a concentrated beam,

1728
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:12,766
but it is unusual.

1729
01:51:12,791 --> 01:51:15,397
This is what makes the Wow! Signal so curious.

1730
01:51:15,422 --> 01:51:18,296
It bears all the hallmarks of a technosignature.

1731
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,177
Just as we have identified hydrogen,

1732
01:51:20,201 --> 01:51:24,797
the most abundant element in the universe, as a means of initiating contact,

1733
01:51:24,821 --> 01:51:26,962
the aliens could've done the same.

1734
01:51:26,987 --> 01:51:31,349
Just as we tend to transmit extremely brief non-repeating messages,

1735
01:51:31,374 --> 01:51:33,530
the aliens could be doing the same.

1736
01:51:34,896 --> 01:51:37,850
Unfortunately, the peculiar design of the Big Ear Telescope

1737
01:51:37,881 --> 01:51:41,302
makes it impossible to pinpoint the source of the signal.

1738
01:51:41,327 --> 01:51:45,585
The setup was such that two large swaths of sky were scanned simultaneously,

1739
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:48,409
but there's no way to tell them apart when looking at the data.

1740
01:51:48,996 --> 01:51:52,200
Even more peculiar is that the signal was only detected once

1741
01:51:52,225 --> 01:51:54,549
despite this dual-scanning design.

1742
01:51:54,996 --> 01:51:56,825
This can only mean one of two things.

1743
01:51:56,850 --> 01:51:59,736
Scenario one is that the source had been transmitting for some

1744
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:02,787
indeterminate amount of time ahead of the first scan,

1745
01:52:02,812 --> 01:52:07,235
yet ceased transmitting before it could be detected again by the second.

1746
01:52:07,260 --> 01:52:10,042
Scenario two is that the source began transmitting

1747
01:52:10,067 --> 01:52:13,156
during the roughly three minute window between the two scans,

1748
01:52:13,181 --> 01:52:16,078
and continued to do so for who knows how long.

1749
01:52:17,298 --> 01:52:21,796
Now, for a signal to carry information, it has to exhibit some sort of pattern.

1750
01:52:21,821 --> 01:52:25,492
For instance, we tend to encode our messages by using a binary pattern

1751
01:52:25,517 --> 01:52:28,263
that shifts back and forth between two different frequencies

1752
01:52:28,287 --> 01:52:29,945
or levels of amplitude.

1753
01:52:30,432 --> 01:52:33,096
The Wow! Signal did not exhibit any such pattern.

1754
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:35,178
Both its frequency and amplitude

1755
01:52:35,203 --> 01:52:39,151
had a constant unmodulated appearance throughout the whole thing.

1756
01:52:39,657 --> 01:52:42,333
That being said, we can't rule out the possibility

1757
01:52:42,345 --> 01:52:44,798
that a sequence of fluctuations were present

1758
01:52:44,823 --> 01:52:48,811
but that they fell below the threshold of what the Big Ear telescope could detect.

1759
01:52:48,836 --> 01:52:51,241
No instrument has infinite resolution

1760
01:52:51,265 --> 01:52:54,376
and Big Ear had some quite significant blind spots.

1761
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:55,590
To quote Ehman...

1762
01:53:06,428 --> 01:53:10,439
On the off-chance that the Wow! Signal was a message from another civilization,

1763
01:53:10,464 --> 01:53:15,901
the National Geographic Channel decided to transmit a reply on its 35th anniversary.

1764
01:53:15,926 --> 01:53:20,359
After collecting over 17 000 tweets and about a dozen video-recorded greetings

1765
01:53:20,371 --> 01:53:22,552
by various celebrities and public figures,

1766
01:53:22,577 --> 01:53:29,012
the Wow! Reply was beamed into space from the Arecibo Telescope on August 15, 2012.

1767
01:53:31,762 --> 01:53:34,925
At least that is what the public was told.

1768
01:53:34,950 --> 01:53:39,013
But after contacting someone who worked at Arecibo when this transmission took place,

1769
01:53:39,038 --> 01:53:42,534
they told me that the stress of beaming thousands of messages into space

1770
01:53:42,559 --> 01:53:46,455
had caused the aging transmitter to overheat and break down.

1771
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:49,232
They could not recall how many messages made it through, but

1772
01:53:49,257 --> 01:53:52,292
it could have been as few as just a single one.

1773
01:53:52,317 --> 01:53:56,569
Now, because the details of the project had already been publicized ahead of time,

1774
01:53:56,594 --> 01:53:58,401
and no correction was ever issued,

1775
01:53:58,426 --> 01:54:01,976
everyone assumed the Wow! Reply went off without a hitch.

1776
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,994
But not only is it unclear how many tweets were sent,

1777
01:54:05,019 --> 01:54:10,411
it's also unclear where they went because the Wow! Reply had three intended targets.

1778
01:54:10,436 --> 01:54:17,330
They were all sunlike stars known as HD 54351, 37 Geminorum, and 55 Cancri A.

1779
01:54:17,355 --> 01:54:18,996
Very little is known about the first,

1780
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:23,128
and it's quite some distance away at 140 lightyears.

1781
01:54:23,153 --> 01:54:25,112
Meanwhile, the other two are much closer

1782
01:54:25,136 --> 01:54:28,249
and have both been targeted by previous METI experiments.

1783
01:54:28,274 --> 01:54:32,122
The person I spoke to could not recall which one was targeted first, so

1784
01:54:32,147 --> 01:54:35,132
my best guess is HD 54351

1785
01:54:35,156 --> 01:54:38,605
because that's the one listed first in a press release about the project.

1786
01:54:39,244 --> 01:54:41,263
Now, with a name like Wow! Reply,

1787
01:54:41,295 --> 01:54:44,647
you'd think the three targets were located within one of the two regions

1788
01:54:44,672 --> 01:54:47,842
from which the Wow! Signal is known to have originated.

1789
01:54:47,867 --> 01:54:51,857
Well, if you did think that, it might be time to recalibrate your common sense

1790
01:54:51,882 --> 01:54:56,241
because all three targets are not only located outside these regions

1791
01:54:56,266 --> 01:54:59,414
but in the complete opposite direction.

1792
01:55:00,061 --> 01:55:01,933
The reason for this is very simple.

1793
01:55:01,958 --> 01:55:04,059
The location where the Wow! Signal was detected

1794
01:55:04,084 --> 01:55:08,597
was beyond the reach of the upward-facing and stationary Arecibo Telescope.

1795
01:55:08,622 --> 01:55:13,665
But if that's the case, why even call it the Wow! Reply in the first place?

1796
01:55:13,690 --> 01:55:17,078
Apart from being transmitted on its 35th anniversary,

1797
01:55:17,103 --> 01:55:20,350
none of this had anything to do with the Wow! Signal.

1798
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:26,548
While the signal does have the hallmarks of an alien transmission,

1799
01:55:26,573 --> 01:55:30,600
there's still a very good chance it was caused by a natural phenomenon.

1800
01:55:30,625 --> 01:55:33,496
It's just a matter of identifying the correct one.

1801
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:35,532
For instance, one recent hypothesis

1802
01:55:35,557 --> 01:55:38,456
tried to blame the whole episode on a pair of passing comets,

1803
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:40,255
but like all previous explanations,

1804
01:55:40,279 --> 01:55:42,936
this one has failed to withstand further scrutiny.

1805
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:47,717
More recently, a paper published in 2024 hypothesized that a powerful flare

1806
01:55:47,742 --> 01:55:49,979
ejected by something like a magnetar

1807
01:55:50,003 --> 01:55:52,376
could've been amplified by a cloud of hydrogen,

1808
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:54,586
which would explain the signal's frequency.

1809
01:55:54,611 --> 01:55:58,107
Whether this is the solution that will finally crack the case

1810
01:55:58,132 --> 01:56:01,496
or be relegated to the mounting list of dead ends,

1811
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:03,022
only time will tell.

1812
01:56:11,584 --> 01:56:14,922
In the early 2010s, a film editor named Pierre Fabre

1813
01:56:14,947 --> 01:56:17,416
conceived of a project dubbed Lone Signal.

1814
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:19,895
Much like Team Encounter and the Cosmic Calls,

1815
01:56:19,907 --> 01:56:23,674
Lone Signal was an attempt to commercialize interstellar messaging.

1816
01:56:23,699 --> 01:56:26,456
The project was envisioned as a social media platform

1817
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:29,888
where anyone could submit text, images, audio, and video

1818
01:56:29,913 --> 01:56:32,296
for direct transmission into space.

1819
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:35,334
Another similarity between Lone Signal and the Cosmic Calls

1820
01:56:35,358 --> 01:56:39,496
was the inclusion of a primer written in a mathematical language of sorts.

1821
01:56:39,521 --> 01:56:42,430
Constructed by planetary scientist Michael Busch,

1822
01:56:42,455 --> 01:56:46,357
every component of this language is represented by a string of eight digits

1823
01:56:46,381 --> 01:56:48,035
between 0 and 7.

1824
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:51,388
For instance, 1 + 1 = 2 looks like this,

1825
01:56:51,413 --> 01:56:54,798
and here on the right is an example of some basic algebra.

1826
01:56:54,823 --> 01:56:57,016
Things only become more complicated from there,

1827
01:56:57,041 --> 01:56:59,816
but I'll spare you the details because, according to Busch,

1828
01:56:59,841 --> 01:57:02,577
the technique used to encode the primer into the signal

1829
01:57:02,602 --> 01:57:07,578
was far too fragile to survive the years-long trip across interstellar space.

1830
01:57:07,603 --> 01:57:09,612
While the signal could still be detected,

1831
01:57:09,636 --> 01:57:12,284
any patterns would become scrambled along the way,

1832
01:57:12,309 --> 01:57:16,582
making it impossible to extract and decode the primer at the destination.

1833
01:57:16,607 --> 01:57:20,500
In other words, alien astronomers may end up with their own Wow! Signal

1834
01:57:20,525 --> 01:57:23,482
that doesn't seem to fluctuate in any meaningful way

1835
01:57:23,507 --> 01:57:27,976
yet whose properties may still be difficult to ascribe to a natural source.

1836
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,622
Now, what truly sets Lone Signal apart from every other initiative mentioned so far

1837
01:57:32,647 --> 01:57:35,039
is that it wasn't a one-time thing.

1838
01:57:35,064 --> 01:57:38,669
Instead of transmitting the primer and public greetings all in one go,

1839
01:57:38,694 --> 01:57:41,236
Lone Signal sought to establish a permanent beacon

1840
01:57:41,261 --> 01:57:45,216
that would continuously transmit for years or even decades.

1841
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:48,844
To make that happen, they couldn't just book time at an active observatory

1842
01:57:48,869 --> 01:57:53,096
but had to obtain long-term exclusive control over a telescope.

1843
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:56,863
After shopping around for a bit, they eventually secured a 30-year lease

1844
01:57:56,888 --> 01:57:59,993
on a decommissioned telescope in southwestern California

1845
01:58:00,018 --> 01:58:02,612
called the Jamesburg Earth Station.

1846
01:58:02,637 --> 01:58:05,334
Then, after upgrading some of its aging equipment,

1847
01:58:05,359 --> 01:58:09,736
Lone Signal began transmitting on June 17, 2013.

1848
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:13,230
But the team behind Lone Signal had even greater ambitions.

1849
01:58:13,255 --> 01:58:16,377
Their long-term plan was to raise $100 million

1850
01:58:16,402 --> 01:58:20,015
and to establish a network of telescopes to continuously signal

1851
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:22,212
multiple targets all at once.

1852
01:58:22,236 --> 01:58:26,850
They likened themselves to SpaceX and hoped to create a global platform

1853
01:58:26,875 --> 01:58:29,612
from which anyone in the world could beam any random thought

1854
01:58:29,636 --> 01:58:32,062
directly into space all day long.

1855
01:58:32,695 --> 01:58:36,543
But in a classic case of history repeating itself,

1856
01:58:36,568 --> 01:58:40,166
the team behind Lone Signal, much like Team Encounter before them,

1857
01:58:40,191 --> 01:58:43,737
vastly overestimated the public's interest in METI.

1858
01:58:43,762 --> 01:58:45,318
Less than two months after launch,

1859
01:58:45,342 --> 01:58:49,939
revenue from the website barely covered 2% of their operational costs.

1860
01:58:49,964 --> 01:58:51,812
Pierre Fabre later wrote in a comment...

1861
01:58:55,116 --> 01:58:59,016
...and that failure led investors to ultimately pull the plug.

1862
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:04,216
Nevertheless, the transmission target was yet another red dwarf called Gliese 526.

1863
01:59:04,240 --> 01:59:08,536
It's less than 18 lightyears away and about twice as old as the Sun.

1864
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:12,696
While it is a relatively quiescent star with only occasional flaring,

1865
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:15,704
a planetary system has yet to be detected.

1866
01:59:15,729 --> 01:59:18,376
Should it be home to a spacefaring civilization,

1867
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:22,311
they will have upwards of two months to notice our cosmic shouting,

1868
01:59:22,336 --> 01:59:25,197
beginning in early 2031.

1869
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:36,058
Back in prehistoric times,

1870
01:59:36,083 --> 01:59:38,360
not long after you pressed play on this documentary,

1871
01:59:38,385 --> 01:59:40,926
I mentioned a series of METI experiments carried out

1872
01:59:40,950 --> 01:59:45,989
by the National Space Development Agency of Japan in the mid-to-late 1990s.

1873
01:59:46,014 --> 01:59:49,257
Designed by young students attending a NASDA space camp,

1874
01:59:49,282 --> 01:59:53,506
these five bitmap images were transmitted from the Usuda Deep Space Center

1875
01:59:53,531 --> 01:59:56,123
to various locations across the galaxy.

1876
01:59:56,148 --> 01:59:59,250
Fast forward to 2013, and the successor to NASDA,

1877
01:59:59,275 --> 02:00:02,056
the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency,

1878
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:04,203
decided it was time to try again.

1879
02:00:04,228 --> 02:00:08,275
During a similar space camp event, and using the same telescope as before,

1880
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:14,583
JAXA retransmitted this image of two parents and a child on September 22, 2013.

1881
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:18,779
A similar bitmap depicting a human standing next to the Sun

1882
02:00:18,804 --> 02:00:22,385
was then transmitted the following year on August 23,

1883
02:00:22,410 --> 02:00:25,255
although it's unclear exactly what it looked like.

1884
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:28,847
Nevertheless, both images were directed at 55 Cancri A

1885
02:00:28,872 --> 02:00:30,449
which has been targeted in the past

1886
02:00:30,474 --> 02:00:33,319
and discussed in more detail in a previous chapter.

1887
02:00:34,179 --> 02:00:38,444
But much like what happened back in the '90s, the JAXA Space Camp Messages

1888
02:00:38,469 --> 02:00:41,828
flew as much through the radar as they did under it.

1889
02:00:41,853 --> 02:00:45,235
Instead, these events were largely overshadowed by new developments

1890
02:00:45,260 --> 02:00:47,377
in the ongoing transmission debate.

1891
02:00:47,402 --> 02:00:52,985
Most notably, in early 2015, over two dozen scientists and SETI enthusiasts,

1892
02:00:53,010 --> 02:00:55,092
including a pre-disgraced Elon Musk,

1893
02:00:55,117 --> 02:00:59,400
signed a petition calling for a "worldwide consensus" regarding METI.

1894
02:00:59,425 --> 02:01:02,306
They took issue with the fact that past METI experiments had been

1895
02:01:02,331 --> 02:01:04,706
"based upon the wishes of a few individuals"

1896
02:01:04,731 --> 02:01:07,441
rather than a "broadly representative body".

1897
02:01:07,466 --> 02:01:11,808
In part because the aliens are likely to be "millions of years more advanced than us",

1898
02:01:11,833 --> 02:01:16,729
but also because "it is impossible to predict whether [they] will be benign or hostile."

1899
02:01:16,754 --> 02:01:20,461
The petition concluded that the potential "consequences of contact"

1900
02:01:20,485 --> 02:01:24,963
demanded "worldwide scientific, political and humanitarian discussion"

1901
02:01:24,988 --> 02:01:27,670
in advance of any future transmissions.

1902
02:01:27,695 --> 02:01:31,235
To which an artist in collaboration with the European Space Agency responded...

1903
02:01:43,143 --> 02:01:47,922
In early 2016, an artist and independent researcher named Paul Quast

1904
02:01:47,947 --> 02:01:53,072
created a crowdsourced art project known as A Simple Response to an Elemental Message.

1905
02:01:53,097 --> 02:01:55,921
It was similar to previous initiatives, except, this time,

1906
02:01:55,933 --> 02:01:59,563
people were asked to frame their submissions as an answer to the question,

1907
02:01:59,588 --> 02:02:03,193
"How will our present environmental interactions shape the future?"

1908
02:02:03,653 --> 02:02:06,852
As the question implies, the project was about climate change

1909
02:02:06,876 --> 02:02:10,695
and sought to capture a global portrait of humanity's thoughts and feelings

1910
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:13,508
about the present and future state of the world.

1911
02:02:13,533 --> 02:02:15,649
As explained by Quast in a few interviews,

1912
02:02:15,674 --> 02:02:19,597
the project was intended more as a time capsule for future generations

1913
02:02:19,622 --> 02:02:22,118
than any potential aliens in outer space.

1914
02:02:22,143 --> 02:02:26,536
This is also reflected by the selection of Polaris as the transmission target.

1915
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:28,427
As mentioned in a previous chapter,

1916
02:02:28,451 --> 02:02:31,748
it's a relatively young and currently planetless system that's

1917
02:02:31,773 --> 02:02:34,268
highly unlikely to host life as we know it.

1918
02:02:34,293 --> 02:02:36,370
Instead, Polaris was primarily selected

1919
02:02:36,394 --> 02:02:40,136
due to its historical significance as the famous North Star.

1920
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:42,840
Nevertheless, A Simple Response to an Elemental Message

1921
02:02:42,865 --> 02:02:46,753
received nearly 4 000 submissions over the course of about eight months.

1922
02:02:46,778 --> 02:02:48,538
In addition to the public messages,

1923
02:02:48,562 --> 02:02:51,738
Quast also included a few copies of the Arecibo Message,

1924
02:02:51,762 --> 02:02:54,076
81 quotes by prominent figures,

1925
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:57,336
and 70 photographs of Earth and humanity.

1926
02:02:57,360 --> 02:03:01,416
All of which was then converted into binary and finally blasted into space

1927
02:03:01,441 --> 02:03:06,827
by the Cebreros Deep Space Ground Station in central Spain on October 10, 2016.

1928
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:20,087
According to a subsequent review by Quast,

1929
02:04:20,111 --> 02:04:23,880
he found that just under 20% of the responses were optimistic,

1930
02:04:23,905 --> 02:04:27,816
just over 42% expressed some form of dread or concern,

1931
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:31,325
while the remaining 38% were largely neutral.

1932
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:45,600
In late 2017, a Spanish music festival known as Sónar

1933
02:04:45,625 --> 02:04:48,660
began transmitting brief snippets of music into space

1934
02:04:48,685 --> 02:04:51,150
to commemorate its 25th anniversary.

1935
02:04:51,175 --> 02:04:54,042
Each composition was no more than 10 seconds in length

1936
02:04:54,067 --> 02:04:57,954
and were provided by 38 musicians with connections to the festival.

1937
02:04:57,979 --> 02:05:02,411
The first 18 were transmitted over the course of three days in October 2017

1938
02:05:02,436 --> 02:05:05,343
from a telescope located in the far north of Norway.

1939
02:05:24,771 --> 02:05:27,011
The remaining batch of 20 was then transmitted

1940
02:05:27,035 --> 02:05:31,569
over the course of another three days in May 2018 using the same facility.

1941
02:05:50,957 --> 02:05:53,176
What makes this initiative a bit more interesting, though,

1942
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:57,252
is the fact that all 38 compositions were preceded by a primer.

1943
02:05:57,277 --> 02:06:00,056
In fact, not just one, but several.

1944
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:04,652
The first one began with two lists of prime numbers intended to attract attention.

1945
02:06:04,677 --> 02:06:07,229
While the primes were technically expressed in binary,

1946
02:06:07,254 --> 02:06:11,189
it would be more accurate to say that they're expressed in unary, repeated twice.

1947
02:06:11,214 --> 02:06:13,927
So 0-0-1-1 for decimal 2,

1948
02:06:13,951 --> 02:06:16,694
0-0-0-1-1-1 for decimal 3,

1949
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:21,134
0-0-0-0-0-1-1-1-1-1 for decimal 5, and so on.

1950
02:06:21,159 --> 02:06:24,966
This was followed by a simple count from 0 to 255

1951
02:06:24,991 --> 02:06:29,464
expressed using eight-digit chunks of binary code, also known as a byte.

1952
02:06:29,797 --> 02:06:32,449
So it goes from eight zeroes representing 0

1953
02:06:32,474 --> 02:06:36,373
all the way up to eight ones representing 255,

1954
02:06:36,385 --> 02:06:39,451
the highest value possible using 8-bit encoding.

1955
02:06:40,191 --> 02:06:43,438
Okay, following that introductory sequence was a second primer

1956
02:06:43,463 --> 02:06:45,564
that differed between the two sessions.

1957
02:06:45,589 --> 02:06:48,439
The one included with the first batch of music was written such that

1958
02:06:48,464 --> 02:06:53,817
all 256 bytes represented a unique number, word, or concept.

1959
02:06:53,842 --> 02:06:57,107
These bytes were then used to convey increasingly complex ideas,

1960
02:06:57,132 --> 02:06:59,816
much the same way it's been done in previous initiatives,

1961
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:04,331
starting with some basic math before delving into things like physics and sound.

1962
02:07:04,985 --> 02:07:07,136
The one included with the second batch of music

1963
02:07:07,148 --> 02:07:10,670
was nearly identical to the one created by Yvan Dutil and Stéphane Dumas

1964
02:07:10,695 --> 02:07:12,576
for Cosmic Call II.

1965
02:07:12,601 --> 02:07:14,684
Some of the components have been shuffled around,

1966
02:07:14,709 --> 02:07:17,162
and there's some updated information about the telescope,

1967
02:07:17,174 --> 02:07:19,344
but otherwise, it's exactly the same.

1968
02:07:19,704 --> 02:07:21,942
Immediately following that was another bitmap

1969
02:07:21,967 --> 02:07:24,686
that tried to graphically convey the concept of a byte

1970
02:07:24,711 --> 02:07:28,300
by counting from 0 to 255 once again.

1971
02:07:29,805 --> 02:07:32,204
This was then followed by an image of a sine wave

1972
02:07:32,228 --> 02:07:35,743
intended to visually convey the concept of sound and music.

1973
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:38,807
Now, the target of these transmissions was

1974
02:07:38,832 --> 02:07:41,861
an ancient red dwarf known as Luyten's Star.

1975
02:07:41,886 --> 02:07:46,213
It's a bit more than 12 lightyears away and harbors two confirmed planets.

1976
02:07:46,238 --> 02:07:50,408
The outermost of which, Luyten b, is about three times the mass of Earth

1977
02:07:50,433 --> 02:07:52,661
and orbits within the star's habitable zone.

1978
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:56,883
In fact, it is one of the nearest earthlike planets ever discovered,

1979
02:07:56,908 --> 02:07:59,407
and it's the sole reason that this system was targeted.

1980
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:03,736
But as mentioned previously, the characteristic dimness of red dwarfs

1981
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:06,878
places the habitable zone very close to the star.

1982
02:08:06,902 --> 02:08:08,366
In the case of Luyten b,

1983
02:08:08,391 --> 02:08:11,971
it orbits about four times closer than Mercury orbits the Sun,

1984
02:08:11,996 --> 02:08:14,709
takes less than 19 days to complete a revolution,

1985
02:08:14,733 --> 02:08:17,709
and is all but guaranteed to be tidally locked.

1986
02:08:18,242 --> 02:08:22,853
On the plus side, Luyten's Star exhibits minimal flaring due to its advanced age.

1987
02:08:23,413 --> 02:08:26,948
Presuming Luyten b is inhabited by an advanced civilization,

1988
02:08:26,973 --> 02:08:32,065
they'd have about 11 minutes per day for three consecutive days in early 2030

1989
02:08:32,090 --> 02:08:33,939
to pick up the first batch of music,

1990
02:08:33,964 --> 02:08:36,607
with the second arriving a few months later.

1991
02:08:37,252 --> 02:08:42,757
Presuming they do so, we could hear back from the Luytenians as early as 2042.

1992
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:56,588
Okay, we've finally reached the most recent interstellar message

1993
02:08:56,613 --> 02:08:58,665
as of the making of this documentary.

1994
02:08:59,132 --> 02:09:00,405
Well, kind of.

1995
02:09:00,430 --> 02:09:01,865
We'll get to that in a moment.

1996
02:09:02,259 --> 02:09:05,335
Following the death of Stephen Hawking in early 2018,

1997
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:09,973
his ashes were interred at a famous church in London called Westminster Abbey.

1998
02:09:09,998 --> 02:09:12,196
As the memorial service came to a close,

1999
02:09:12,221 --> 02:09:15,047
an original score set against Hawking's iconic voice

2000
02:09:15,072 --> 02:09:17,465
and written by Greek composer Vangelis

2001
02:09:17,490 --> 02:09:19,528
was simultaneously beamed into space

2002
02:09:19,552 --> 02:09:24,074
from the Cebreros Deep Space Ground Station on June 15, 2018.

2003
02:09:24,627 --> 02:09:28,847
The target was a binary system nearly five thousand lightyears away

2004
02:09:28,871 --> 02:09:31,416
known as V616 Monocerotis.

2005
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:35,994
It's composed of a star with about one-third the mass of the Sun and...

2006
02:09:36,018 --> 02:09:37,585
...a black hole.

2007
02:09:37,610 --> 02:09:40,856
At the time, it was the nearest black hole to the Solar System,

2008
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:44,616
although it has since been dethroned by at least a few other candidates.

2009
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:46,505
Now, paying tribute to Stephen Hawking

2010
02:09:46,530 --> 02:09:49,693
by beaming his voice into space may seem like an odd choice,

2011
02:09:49,717 --> 02:09:53,519
considering he was a very outspoken critic of METI.

2012
02:09:53,544 --> 02:09:55,516
But as explained by his daughter Lucy,

2013
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:57,778
the broadcast was a purely symbolic gesture

2014
02:09:57,802 --> 02:10:01,215
intended not only to celebrate his scientific contributions,

2015
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:05,050
but also to fulfill his lifelong dream of going into space.

2016
02:10:05,075 --> 02:10:07,728
This is further reflected by the transmission target,

2017
02:10:07,752 --> 02:10:11,519
as Hawking dedicated much of his life to the study of black holes.

2018
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:14,317
Besides, we're hardly gonna make contact with aliens

2019
02:10:14,342 --> 02:10:16,391
in the vicinity of a black hole, right?

2020
02:10:17,456 --> 02:10:20,551
Well, so, about that...

2021
02:10:30,820 --> 02:10:32,772
This is a view of the Solar System

2022
02:10:32,796 --> 02:10:37,157
showing all five interstellar spacecraft that humanity has launched to date.

2023
02:10:38,090 --> 02:10:39,614
If we zoom out a bit further,

2024
02:10:39,646 --> 02:10:42,816
we can see 23 of the nearest star systems

2025
02:10:42,841 --> 02:10:46,853
targeted by at least one of the radio transmissions mentioned in this video.

2026
02:10:47,365 --> 02:10:51,718
But to see the two most distant targets, we have to zoom out to a galactic scale.

2027
02:10:52,052 --> 02:10:57,438
Here we find V616 Monocerotis, the target of Stephen Hawking's Memorial Broadcast,

2028
02:10:57,463 --> 02:11:01,870
and finally Messier 13, the target of the Arecibo Message.

2029
02:11:02,410 --> 02:11:05,114
But this is by no means an exhaustive list.

2030
02:11:05,139 --> 02:11:07,699
Some radio transmissions, marked here in grey,

2031
02:11:07,724 --> 02:11:11,220
did not make the cut because they failed to meet one of two criteria

2032
02:11:11,245 --> 02:11:13,176
that I made up for this video.

2033
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:16,873
The first one is that a transmission must be deliberately directed

2034
02:11:16,897 --> 02:11:18,936
at an extrasolar target.

2035
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:22,290
After all, the goal of METI is to contact another intelligence,

2036
02:11:22,315 --> 02:11:25,462
so projects that aimlessly blast messages into space with

2037
02:11:25,487 --> 02:11:28,297
no particular target in mind do not count.

2038
02:11:28,664 --> 02:11:31,773
This includes signals that could accidentally be detected,

2039
02:11:31,798 --> 02:11:34,497
like those routinely transmitted by astronomers to

2040
02:11:34,521 --> 02:11:39,096
communicate with spacecraft or map the surface of bodies within the Solar System.

2041
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:41,895
To give you an example, in late 1962,

2042
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:46,362
a group of Soviet astronomers used this absolute beast of a telescope

2043
02:11:46,387 --> 02:11:49,399
to bounce radar signals off the surface of Venus.

2044
02:11:49,424 --> 02:11:52,098
For a bit of fun, they decided to modulate the radar pulses

2045
02:11:52,122 --> 02:11:56,760
to spell out the words MIR, LENIN, and USSR using Morse Code.

2046
02:11:56,785 --> 02:11:59,936
This is sometimes described as the first interstellar message

2047
02:11:59,961 --> 02:12:03,621
because a lot of that radiation went right past Venus

2048
02:12:03,646 --> 02:12:05,560
and continued on into deep space.

2049
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:07,749
Now, if you read about this online,

2050
02:12:07,774 --> 02:12:10,846
you'll find claims that some portion of that excess radiation

2051
02:12:10,871 --> 02:12:15,816
is currently heading for an obscure binary system known as HD 131336

2052
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:18,668
that's well over a thousand lightyears away.

2053
02:12:18,693 --> 02:12:20,843
The phrasing can often make it seem as though this was

2054
02:12:20,868 --> 02:12:24,169
planned by the original scientists back in 1962,

2055
02:12:24,193 --> 02:12:26,136
but that is not the case.

2056
02:12:26,160 --> 02:12:29,785
The true source of this claim is a forum post from 2002

2057
02:12:29,810 --> 02:12:33,775
in which an amateur astronomer did some quick back-of-the-napkin calculations

2058
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:38,691
to suggest HD 131336 might have been near the path of the signal

2059
02:12:38,716 --> 02:12:42,616
depending on the precise time of transmission, which is unknown.

2060
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:45,123
Given the imprecision of that guesstimate

2061
02:12:45,135 --> 02:12:47,576
and the fact that the intended target was Venus,

2062
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:50,254
I decided not to include it on my list.

2063
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:54,790
The second criterion is that the strength of a transmitted signal

2064
02:12:54,815 --> 02:12:57,656
must be greater than 100 megawatts.

2065
02:12:57,680 --> 02:13:01,675
Now, for any radio astronomers watching, here I'm not talking about output power,

2066
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:05,569
but the much more crucial parameter, which is the effective radiated power

2067
02:13:05,594 --> 02:13:09,242
that accounts for things like transmission frequency and gain of the antenna.

2068
02:13:09,267 --> 02:13:12,039
For anyone curious, you can find a spreadsheet in the references

2069
02:13:12,064 --> 02:13:15,165
with all the incredibly exciting technical details.

2070
02:13:15,190 --> 02:13:18,063
Anyway, there's nothing special about 100 megawatts.

2071
02:13:18,087 --> 02:13:20,983
I just needed some way to filter out some of the weaker transmissions

2072
02:13:21,008 --> 02:13:25,391
from the stronger ones, and this seemed like a nice even number to draw that line.

2073
02:13:25,416 --> 02:13:27,797
It's neither so high that everything is excluded

2074
02:13:27,822 --> 02:13:29,976
nor so low that everything is included.

2075
02:13:30,001 --> 02:13:32,796
It's just a way to rein in the scope of this video.

2076
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:37,269
While I tried to be as forgiving as possible with these two criteria,

2077
02:13:37,294 --> 02:13:39,697
you could, of course, be a lot more strict.

2078
02:13:39,721 --> 02:13:43,176
For instance, it is very common to categorize METI experiments

2079
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:47,866
based on how earnest or frivolous most experts perceive them to be.

2080
02:13:47,891 --> 02:13:50,750
Take the Doritos Broadcast Project as an example.

2081
02:13:50,775 --> 02:13:54,052
It is typically not regarded as a genuine attempt at METI

2082
02:13:54,076 --> 02:13:58,722
because transmitting a commercial into space is obviously just a publicity stunt.

2083
02:13:58,746 --> 02:14:02,923
It's rather silly, unscientific, and utterly indecipherable.

2084
02:14:02,948 --> 02:14:07,479
To use the terminology favored by Alexander Zaitsev, it's "pseudo-METI".

2085
02:14:07,504 --> 02:14:10,744
But as I've stressed multiple times throughout this video,

2086
02:14:10,769 --> 02:14:13,072
what we say isn't all that important

2087
02:14:13,096 --> 02:14:16,225
because we're probably not going to be understood anyway.

2088
02:14:16,250 --> 02:14:18,641
What is important is that the signal has been

2089
02:14:18,666 --> 02:14:21,305
modulated or manipulated in such a way

2090
02:14:21,329 --> 02:14:24,308
that it does not resemble anything else in the universe.

2091
02:14:24,333 --> 02:14:28,696
As long as the recipients are unable to ascribe the signal to a natural source,

2092
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:32,880
they will have no choice but to entertain the possibility of intelligent design.

2093
02:14:33,314 --> 02:14:36,274
Besides, the distinction between genuine and pseudo-METI

2094
02:14:36,298 --> 02:14:38,834
is highly subjective and inconsistent.

2095
02:14:38,859 --> 02:14:43,152
For instance, the Arecibo Message is usually upheld as a prime example of METI

2096
02:14:43,177 --> 02:14:46,524
despite Frank Drake himself describing it as a publicity stunt,

2097
02:14:46,549 --> 02:14:48,897
and much of it is indecipherable.

2098
02:14:48,922 --> 02:14:53,203
Likewise, the Message to Altair is typically regarded as genuine METI

2099
02:14:53,228 --> 02:14:57,115
even though the Doritos Broadcast Project was about five times more powerful

2100
02:14:57,139 --> 02:14:59,490
and lasted six times longer.

2101
02:15:00,110 --> 02:15:04,234
Another approach would be to sort METI experiments based on the distance to

2102
02:15:04,259 --> 02:15:06,491
and habitability of the target.

2103
02:15:06,516 --> 02:15:09,491
You could, for instance, exclude the Arecibo Message because

2104
02:15:09,516 --> 02:15:13,966
M13 is extremely far away and unlikely to be habitable.

2105
02:15:13,991 --> 02:15:16,586
Same thing with Stephen Hawking's Memorial Broadcast

2106
02:15:16,611 --> 02:15:20,234
directed at a black hole many thousands of lightyears away.

2107
02:15:20,694 --> 02:15:22,646
But here's where things get a bit tricky because

2108
02:15:22,671 --> 02:15:26,106
how do we determine when a target is too far away?

2109
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:31,169
In other words, how do we know when a signal is too weak or sufficiently strong

2110
02:15:31,194 --> 02:15:35,709
to be detected by an alien civilization of which we know nothing about?

2111
02:15:36,684 --> 02:15:40,911
The simplest approach would be to assume the recipients are no more advanced than us

2112
02:15:40,936 --> 02:15:44,558
and use our present level of technology and scientific understanding

2113
02:15:44,583 --> 02:15:46,759
as a baseline for detectability.

2114
02:15:47,078 --> 02:15:50,226
In other words, if we can't detect it, neither can they.

2115
02:15:50,953 --> 02:15:53,273
If that's the case, they would definitely struggle

2116
02:15:53,298 --> 02:15:55,653
if not be outright unable to detect

2117
02:15:55,678 --> 02:15:57,973
some of the messages mentioned in this video.

2118
02:15:59,146 --> 02:16:02,022
But should we really make that assumption?

2119
02:16:02,047 --> 02:16:04,234
Well, to paraphrase Carl Sagan,

2120
02:16:04,259 --> 02:16:07,301
any civilization even just slightly behind us

2121
02:16:07,326 --> 02:16:10,162
wouldn't be able to receive or transmit,

2122
02:16:10,187 --> 02:16:14,992
whereas any civilization on par with or billions of years ahead of us

2123
02:16:15,016 --> 02:16:16,238
could be.

2124
02:16:16,263 --> 02:16:18,321
Odds are they will be more advanced,

2125
02:16:18,346 --> 02:16:22,451
making range and detectability estimates based on the assumption that they're not

2126
02:16:22,476 --> 02:16:24,037
feel rather pointless.

2127
02:16:25,040 --> 02:16:28,604
But it feels equally pointless to assume that they are more advanced because

2128
02:16:28,629 --> 02:16:31,697
then it just comes down to who writes the best science fiction.

2129
02:16:32,173 --> 02:16:35,656
Does more advanced mean they have instruments that are similar to our own

2130
02:16:35,681 --> 02:16:38,202
but simply larger and more sensitive?

2131
02:16:38,701 --> 02:16:41,593
Does it mean they have long since abandoned radio technology

2132
02:16:41,618 --> 02:16:43,542
in favor of something else entirely?

2133
02:16:44,155 --> 02:16:47,638
Does it mean they have a more sophisticated understanding of physics,

2134
02:16:47,663 --> 02:16:51,719
and that their technology would appear to us as nothing short of magic?

2135
02:17:24,479 --> 02:17:27,305
Habitability estimates suffer from a similar problem because

2136
02:17:27,330 --> 02:17:30,392
we obviously don't know if what we regard as habitable

2137
02:17:30,416 --> 02:17:33,278
is the same as what they regard as habitable.

2138
02:17:33,303 --> 02:17:37,188
Even if we assume that intelligent life can exclusively emerge

2139
02:17:37,213 --> 02:17:40,316
on earthlike planets orbiting sunlike stars,

2140
02:17:40,340 --> 02:17:42,012
that does not mean

2141
02:17:42,036 --> 02:17:43,751
they will stay there.

2142
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:47,173
Perhaps there comes a time in the lifespan of any civilization

2143
02:17:47,198 --> 02:17:52,445
when their energy requirements outpace that which can be provided by sunlike stars?

2144
02:17:52,470 --> 02:17:56,106
Perhaps life is destined to seek out more extreme environments

2145
02:17:56,131 --> 02:17:59,490
that we would never even think of as being habitable today?

2146
02:17:59,515 --> 02:18:03,487
Perhaps the messages we've sent towards places most unlike our own...

2147
02:18:04,187 --> 02:18:06,933
...are the most likely to receive a response?

2148
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:14,938
All this ambiguity is, of course, a big reason why many are so opposed to METI

2149
02:18:14,963 --> 02:18:18,311
because the unknown allows us to imagine the worst.

2150
02:18:18,909 --> 02:18:20,801
For instance, in early 2010,

2151
02:18:20,825 --> 02:18:23,916
Stephen Hawking cautioned against deliberate communication attempts

2152
02:18:23,941 --> 02:18:26,870
out of concern that aliens might not be too dissimilar

2153
02:18:26,895 --> 02:18:28,955
from our past and present selves.

2154
02:18:44,746 --> 02:18:47,284
As we've already seen throughout this video,

2155
02:18:47,296 --> 02:18:51,428
this pessimistic view on humanity and first contact is very common,

2156
02:18:51,453 --> 02:18:52,735
and for good reason.

2157
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:55,484
There are plenty of examples throughout human history

2158
02:18:55,509 --> 02:18:57,651
in which a less developed society

2159
02:18:57,663 --> 02:18:59,946
suffered at the hands of a more advanced one.

2160
02:19:00,560 --> 02:19:03,765
The problem with pessimism, though, is that it's one-sided.

2161
02:19:03,790 --> 02:19:08,136
It would be just as easy to leverage more positive trends and behaviours

2162
02:19:08,148 --> 02:19:10,285
in support of an optimistic outcome.

2163
02:19:10,310 --> 02:19:13,362
For instance, consider this critique by philosopher Guy Kahane.

2164
02:19:43,254 --> 02:19:46,829
Considering how much we've improved in a very short span of time,

2165
02:19:46,854 --> 02:19:50,795
things like child mortality, homicides, and poverty are declining

2166
02:19:50,820 --> 02:19:55,163
while access to clean water, electricity, and life expectancy are increasing

2167
02:19:55,188 --> 02:19:59,297
we only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop

2168
02:19:59,322 --> 02:20:01,484
into something we would want to meet.

2169
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:05,722
Perhaps not humanity of today since, you know, there's still...

2170
02:20:05,747 --> 02:20:07,414
...plenty of room for improvement.

2171
02:20:07,439 --> 02:20:11,794
But if we project these positive trend lines sufficiently far into the future,

2172
02:20:11,819 --> 02:20:15,869
it's possible that much older civilizations will have long since outgrown

2173
02:20:15,894 --> 02:20:18,012
their more destructive tendencies.

2174
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:44,776
Just as Hawking justified his belief that aliens will be hostile by saying,

2175
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:47,008
"Look at all the bad things we've done,"

2176
02:20:47,032 --> 02:20:50,738
Frank Drake justified his belief that aliens will be friendly by saying,

2177
02:20:50,763 --> 02:20:52,817
"Look at our capacity for growth."

2178
02:20:53,164 --> 02:20:56,875
Neither argument is more or less valid than the other because

2179
02:20:56,900 --> 02:20:59,300
we're obviously capable of both.

2180
02:20:59,867 --> 02:21:02,305
But as the anti-METI crowd will often point out,

2181
02:21:02,330 --> 02:21:05,085
this uncertainty is the problem.

2182
02:21:05,110 --> 02:21:08,523
They will often argue that the mere possibility of an existential threat

2183
02:21:08,548 --> 02:21:10,783
outweighs any potential benefits.

2184
02:21:11,196 --> 02:21:13,985
To reiterate a quote from much earlier in the video...

2185
02:21:32,080 --> 02:21:35,515
A common counterargument among those in favor of METI is that

2186
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:38,541
it's too late to worry about hostile aliens because

2187
02:21:38,565 --> 02:21:42,413
we've been leaking radio signals into space for the better part of a century.

2188
02:21:42,438 --> 02:21:46,242
Anyone within about 100 lightyears of Earth could, in theory,

2189
02:21:46,267 --> 02:21:50,073
detect our presence by intercepting our television broadcasts.

2190
02:21:50,393 --> 02:21:53,047
But as opponents of METI are often quick to point out,

2191
02:21:53,072 --> 02:21:57,521
this unintentional leakage is extremely faint and diffused.

2192
02:21:57,546 --> 02:22:00,067
While it's impossible to say what signals are

2193
02:22:00,092 --> 02:22:02,702
too faint for an alien civilization to detect,

2194
02:22:02,727 --> 02:22:07,256
a weaker signal is obviously more difficult to detect than a stronger one.

2195
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:11,432
But it's not just about signal strength, it's also about intent.

2196
02:22:11,457 --> 02:22:14,768
An archer blindly shooting arrows in random directions

2197
02:22:14,792 --> 02:22:17,298
is a lot less likely to strike a bullseye

2198
02:22:17,323 --> 02:22:19,992
than the archer aiming for the target.

2199
02:22:20,017 --> 02:22:23,896
Sure, radio leakage could accidentally expose our presence,

2200
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:28,067
but METI goes out of its way to maximize that outcome.

2201
02:22:28,399 --> 02:22:30,745
It's the difference between a ship lost at sea

2202
02:22:30,770 --> 02:22:34,327
that happens to spot the faint glow of a coastal town...

2203
02:22:34,351 --> 02:22:36,007
...and a lighthouse.

2204
02:22:36,032 --> 02:22:37,883
There isn't much we can do about the former

2205
02:22:37,908 --> 02:22:40,905
because it's merely a byproduct of our civilization.

2206
02:22:40,930 --> 02:22:43,097
But there's plenty we could do about the latter,

2207
02:22:43,122 --> 02:22:46,295
like, you know, not build a lighthouse.

2208
02:22:46,319 --> 02:22:50,694
While some critics advocate for precisely that, a planetwide ban on METI,

2209
02:22:50,719 --> 02:22:54,937
such proposals are often countered by what's known as the SETI Paradox.

2210
02:22:54,962 --> 02:22:56,112
It goes something like this.

2211
02:22:56,137 --> 02:22:58,294
If we conclude that METI is too risky,

2212
02:22:58,319 --> 02:23:01,380
and other civilizations reach that same conclusion,

2213
02:23:01,405 --> 02:23:05,097
what would be the point of SETI if no one is transmitting?

2214
02:23:05,122 --> 02:23:06,970
To quote the man who coined the term...

2215
02:23:14,479 --> 02:23:18,496
The obvious problem with this argument is the assumption that all civilizations

2216
02:23:18,521 --> 02:23:22,803
independently and inevitably reach the same conclusion.

2217
02:23:22,828 --> 02:23:25,544
Even if we decided to cease transmitting tomorrow,

2218
02:23:25,568 --> 02:23:30,325
that doesn't mean all other civilizations must behave as we do.

2219
02:23:30,350 --> 02:23:34,696
In fact, this argument doesn't work even if METI is universally rejected

2220
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:37,087
because an absence of deliberate emissions

2221
02:23:37,111 --> 02:23:40,573
does not preclude the detection of unintentional ones,

2222
02:23:40,597 --> 02:23:42,285
even if it's a lot less likely.

2223
02:23:42,559 --> 02:23:45,532
So the SETI Paradox isn't much of a paradox at all.

2224
02:23:45,557 --> 02:23:50,511
It makes perfect sense to keep listening even if we never send another message.

2225
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:53,866
But this is just a hypothetical, of course, because we

2226
02:23:53,891 --> 02:23:56,733
probably will send more messages in the future.

2227
02:23:56,757 --> 02:24:00,767
After all, a planetwide ban would be extremely difficult to enforce,

2228
02:24:00,792 --> 02:24:05,335
which is why some critics seek not to keep quiet but to regulate the noise.

2229
02:24:05,359 --> 02:24:08,696
While there's no consensus on what form such regulation should take,

2230
02:24:08,720 --> 02:24:12,296
popular ideas include an international treaty or policy

2231
02:24:12,321 --> 02:24:14,455
that places restrictions on METI,

2232
02:24:14,479 --> 02:24:17,186
some sort of review board or oversight committee

2233
02:24:17,211 --> 02:24:19,814
elected to make decisions on humanity's behalf,

2234
02:24:19,839 --> 02:24:22,135
or a democratic process where

2235
02:24:22,159 --> 02:24:25,534
presumably everyone in the world gets a vote?

2236
02:24:26,114 --> 02:24:29,500
The logistics of which I don't even dare to think about.

2237
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:33,680
While different policies and regulations could go a long way

2238
02:24:33,705 --> 02:24:35,976
to reduce the number of transmissions,

2239
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,884
they're unlikely to eliminate the practice entirely.

2240
02:24:38,909 --> 02:24:41,037
If people want to do something badly enough,

2241
02:24:41,061 --> 02:24:43,291
there will always be a way to do it.

2242
02:24:43,315 --> 02:24:46,717
Outlaw METI in one country, and people will go to another.

2243
02:24:46,742 --> 02:24:50,079
Make it illegal around the world, and people will do it in secret.

2244
02:24:50,632 --> 02:24:52,753
Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if a few messages

2245
02:24:52,778 --> 02:24:55,074
have been dispatched in secret already.

2246
02:24:55,444 --> 02:24:56,121
Think about it.

2247
02:24:56,145 --> 02:24:59,284
Radio telescopes have been around for well over half a century.

2248
02:24:59,309 --> 02:25:02,946
You're telling me not a single person has had the means and motive

2249
02:25:02,971 --> 02:25:06,831
to beam a quick text to Proxima Centauri when no one else was looking?

2250
02:25:07,154 --> 02:25:09,054
I'm not saying it's common, of course, but...

2251
02:25:09,514 --> 02:25:10,734
...not once?

2252
02:25:11,548 --> 02:25:13,041
I don't know about that.

2253
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:50,431
As pointed out by evolutionary biologist Wallace Arthur,

2254
02:25:50,456 --> 02:25:55,604
we are, for better or worse, a species that cannot stand not knowing.

2255
02:25:55,629 --> 02:25:57,736
Whether it's the other side of a mountain,

2256
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:59,303
the other side of an ocean,

2257
02:25:59,328 --> 02:26:01,243
or the other side of the galaxy,

2258
02:26:01,268 --> 02:26:04,074
the unknown will always evoke fear in some,

2259
02:26:04,099 --> 02:26:07,126
and irresistible curiosity in others.

2260
02:26:07,640 --> 02:26:11,192
No amount of debating is going to change that.

2261
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:15,001
Now, fortunately for those of you in camp fear,

2262
02:26:15,026 --> 02:26:19,576
METI is extraordinarily unlikely to succeed.

2263
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:23,490
The stars we've targeted so far only account for a tiny fraction

2264
02:26:23,515 --> 02:26:27,714
of the hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy.

2265
02:26:27,739 --> 02:26:31,046
Most of which are within just a few tens of lightyears of Earth

2266
02:26:31,071 --> 02:26:35,403
even though the galaxy is about 100 000 lightyears across.

2267
02:26:35,805 --> 02:26:37,617
For one of our messages to be received,

2268
02:26:37,641 --> 02:26:41,284
the Milky Way is either so jam-packed with communicative civilizations

2269
02:26:41,309 --> 02:26:43,914
that it's basically impossible to miss,

2270
02:26:43,939 --> 02:26:46,297
or we would need to be luckier than the combined luck

2271
02:26:46,322 --> 02:26:48,452
of all humans who have ever lucked...

2272
02:26:48,476 --> 02:26:49,839
...and then some.

2273
02:26:50,299 --> 02:26:52,344
It's still fun to think about, of course,

2274
02:26:52,369 --> 02:26:55,592
in the same way it's fun to think about other improbabilities like

2275
02:26:55,617 --> 02:26:56,776
winning the lottery.

2276
02:26:57,399 --> 02:26:58,872
It could happen,

2277
02:26:58,896 --> 02:27:00,988
but it's probably not going to.

2278
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:04,385
So, in my view, it doesn't really matter either way.

2279
02:27:04,410 --> 02:27:06,454
But if I had to pick a side,

2280
02:27:06,479 --> 02:27:11,366
I think I'm more persuaded by the arguments against METI than those in favor.

2281
02:27:11,391 --> 02:27:14,822
As much as I would like to have confirmation that we're not alone,

2282
02:27:14,847 --> 02:27:17,410
tying one end of a rope around your waist

2283
02:27:17,435 --> 02:27:19,308
and the other end around humanity

2284
02:27:19,333 --> 02:27:22,045
before sprinting headfirst into a dark room

2285
02:27:22,069 --> 02:27:24,317
hoping there isn't a hole in the floor

2286
02:27:24,341 --> 02:27:27,014
is probably not the wisest approach.

2287
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:29,043
Thank you for watching.
